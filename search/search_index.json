Until a global trusted network can be put together, we need to launch a Canadian-focused network as the most secure and equitable way to move forward. The members of the Canacred represent a group of volunteers striving to create and promote hosted-in-Canada Utility. The Canacred serves the purpose of raising, budgeting and spending funds in support of the Utility and the Canacred Wallet, which will be tasked with providing Canadians with user-friendly, secure and trustworthy digital credentials wallet. The Canacred is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in digital trust ecosystems and require an governance framework that will strive to follow principles of SSI and and leverage guiding principles introduced by Pan-Canadian Trust Framework: Support robust, secure, scalable solutions Implement, protect, and enhance privacy by design Be inclusive, open, and meet broad stakeholder needs Provide Canadians with choice, control, and convenience Build on open standards-based protocols Minimize data transfer between sources and avoid creation of new or expanded identity information repositories Be transparent in governance and operation To meet these requirements, the Canacred Utility operates pursuant to its own governance framework. Network members pay annual membership fees and provide supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility that is structured as an enterprise safe-space and purpose built for trusted ecosystem for verified credentials. The Network leverages an independent Utility Service Provider as a fee-based administrator for the delivery of a DID Ledger associated with a unique DID Root Namespace, did:ccn .

The Canadian Credential Network is a project that supports the operation of the Canadain Credential Network Utility (the \u201cUtility\u201d or \"CCNU\"), an independent self-governed and self-sustainable public identity utility. The members of the Canadian Credential Network represent a collection of Canadian private and public sector companies and other organizations that operate and manage the Utility. The Canadian Credential Network serves the purpose of raising, budgeting and spending funds in support of the Utility and the Canacred Wallet Project , which is tasked with the mission of supporting the technical needs of the Utility. What are the key markets that would use the CCNU? \u00b6 The CCNU is designed to be a public access utility for all industries and sectors. Participation in the CCNU is not restricted to any set of industries. How does a business benefit from joining the CCNU? \u00b6 We know that convening ecosystems is time consuming and challenging. The CCNU will become an established digital trust ecosystem supplying a permissioned infrastructure to foster accelerated ecosystem adoption eliminating the need for individual organizations to \u201cgrow their own\u201d \u2013 reducing cost and complexity and improving speed to market when implementing a solution. Becoming a member of this network affords businesses a low cost option to access a trusted, decentralized ledger that enforces privacy regulation, a sustainable financial model, collective ownership and adherence to open standards and protocols of ToIP as well as access to a wide range of ecosystem partners. Read access to the Canadain Credential Network Utility is open to all types of entities. Write access is limited to members good standing within the Canadian Credential Network. As contributors to the infrastructure of a public identity utility, CCNU members are entitled to unlimited or limited write access rights depending on membership level. Membership rates are determined by the selected membership level (e.g. Governing, Operational or Subscriber). Details can be found in Pricing . Who makes up the governing board? \u00b6 The Governing Board is comprised of representatives from members as outlined in the Canadian Credential Network\u2019s Charter. Details can be found in the Canadian Credential Network Participation Agreement . How will the CCNU onboard legitimate financially sounds members? \u00b6 The CCNU Governance Framework outlines membership qualification policies for the onboarding of financial stability and legitimacy companies. These qualified members will provide the infrastructure for the CCNU. The Membership Committee is tasked with the procedures and processes for running membership campaigns to keep membership quantity and quality stable for sustainability of the public identity utility. What service level requirements will a member be required to adhere to? \u00b6 Each member must sign a set of legal agreements that cover the obligations, restrictions and other concerns associated with the role a member will play within the Network. Member requirements by role are described in detail Participation and Utility Agreements . Who will be able to access the network? \u00b6 The CCNU, a public identity utility, is publicly accessible for members and non-members via read access only APIs. Members will have the ability to write to CCNU. Write access entitlements will depend on membership type . Who controls what is written to the CCNU? \u00b6 A Transaction Endorser is a data processor that works on behalf of a data controller, known as a Transaction Author. A Transaction Endorser is responsible for adhering to the Endorser Technical and Organizational Policies as well as all relevant Canadian Credential Network Ledger Access Policies . A Trust Assurance Framework is also used to ensure that a Transaction Endorser can supply evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards. How is the CCNU different from the Sovrin Foundation? \u00b6 The goals of the CCNU are based on a number of motivating factors . To this end, the CCNU strives to: Enforce permissioned-writes with contractual instruments that will conform to privacy regulations such as GDPR and Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. Maintain financial sustainability of the Canacred members without the use of cryptographic tokens. Establish a governing board so that no single organization owns the public identity utility. Require adherence to specified open standards and protocols. Why is the CCNU not using a crypto/token payment model? \u00b6 The CCNU will operate on token-free economics as the risks and sustainability of a public write token payment model have yet to be proven. What agreements is a member required to sign to join the CCNU? \u00b6 Each member must sign a set of legal agreements that cover the obligations, restrictions and other concerns associated with the role a member will play within the network. Member requirements by role are described in detail Participation and Utility Agreements . How much does it cost to be a member? \u00b6 Membership rates will be determined by the selected membership level (e.g. Governing, Operational or Subscriber). Details can be found in Economic Policies . Who is responsible for hosting and managing a node? \u00b6 Any member of the Canadain Credential Network Utility that is required to host a utility infrastructure node is considered a Steward and is responsible for the financial demands of hosting a node.

Over several years, it evolved into an industry brand associated with decentralized identity. It represents more than an instance of a decentralized identity network based on a DLT, it is a trusted community of like-minded people and institutions from a variety of geographic regions and industry sectors. The Sovrin Community aspires to help all the entities (citizens, governments, businesses, devices) of the world to fix identity for both online and physical interactions. During this same period, a global spotlight on privacy protection has spawned regulation such as GDPR and CCPA, which complements the spirit of the decentralized identity movement. However, these regulations also place additional financial risk and compliance constraints on businesses that desire to participate in and contribute to this privacy protection movement. At the same time, the grassroots energy focused on \u201cidentity for all\u201d shifted or accelerated the thinking within the Sovrin Community towards a public permission-less utility that leverages a cryptographic utility token. These philosophical changes, while socially acceptable, create a number of risk mitigation dilemmas for participating institutions. As a result, some businesses have exited the community while others have been hesitant to join. Meanwhile, the hype around decentralized identity also spawned new federated identity systems like the Global Association for Digital Identity (GADI) from the DID Alliance that promote marketing messages under the banner of decentralized identity while actually establishing architectures that contradict the core Privacy by Design Principles . GADI architecture enables a collection of Digital Address Providers (DAPs) to centrally manage identities for individuals whereas the Sovrin Community advocates for an architecture that allows identities to be managed without reliance on any external administrative authority. The Sovrin Community is comprised of minimally two disparate market segments. Both segments can agree on an Open by Design governance approach. While the members within each market segment may require incompatible governance models, both segments adamantly disagree with any deviation from an open approach at the technology or governance levels. To counter the pendulum bob swinging so far to the left, we have witnessed proposals for alternative proprietary solutions that reflect an unacceptable swing of the bob to the right. This oscillation between extremes depicts an opportunity to steer the pendulum bob to a center position that would allow institutions to strike a balance between open privacy by design and financial risks. Reality Check \u00b6 In the Autumn of 2019, early prospective members of the Canadian Credential Network responded to this quest to bring the pendulum bob back to center. The result was the formation of the Canadian Credential Network Utility which was intended to address three key concerns: Policy Gridlock Permissioned Safe Zone Token-free Economics Policy Gridlock \u00b6 The Sovrin approach for decentralized identity was to tackle it at global scale. The Sovrin Community, much like the global societies it sought to represent, struggled with the formation of policies that can be embraced all at once by its members. The balancing of diversity goals at the operational level, risk mitigation for privacy regulation compliance, identity access for all, and the sustainability of a stable and reliable network was a non-trivial exercise. The technology adoption lifecycle teaches us that we cannot assume that all interested stakeholders will be able to embrace and adopt the technology at the same rate. The Sovrin Foundation needed to find ways for it to [a] stay true to its vision; [b] aid all stakeholders on their decentralized identity journey; and [c] remain financially sustainable. Businesses and Governments around the world must be able to balance risk mitigation and technology adoption if Sovrin was to be an open community for all. Additionally, all stakeholders must accept the fact that a single network (DID ledger) cannot serve the entire globe. As an example, the Sovrin Network was based on Hyperledger Indy, which like many consensus algorithms, carries an expected threshold of optimal validator nodes, thereby limiting the scalability of a single network. The decentralized identity community cannot afford to have disputes at the network level. We must focus on market creation not market bifurcation. We live in a heterogeneous world of networks where interoperability is paramount. A single network cannot meet the needs of everyone and continued attempts to do so will minimally yield increased complexity and confusion. These facts became reality within the Sovrin Foundation as it became difficult to obtain closure after nearly a year on Version 2 of the Sovrin Governance Framework. The Sovrin Foundation was in gridlock throughout all of 2019 due to apprehension between policy decisions that were necessary for one market segment and uncomfortable for another. These concerns impacted the business market segment as well as external coalitions such as FINDY and KIVA who may have desired to have their own governance framework while participating in the Sovrin Community. One approach to breaking the gridlock while still enabling two market segments to co-exist was to establish a community bound to a common vision but comprised of safe-spaces for each segment to establish their own governance. Permissioned Safe Zone \u00b6 Preventive measures for avoiding the possible insertion of personal data into an immutable ledger has been the focus of much discussion. While many have agreed that a 100% guarantee is not possible, the implementation of a public write model only increases such exposure thereby making interested stakeholders more apprehensive to embrace a permission-less governance model. A diligent effort was made within the Sovrin Foundation to address the regulatory risks (i.e.: CCPA, GDPR) associated community stakeholders. In collaboration with legal experts, the community established a series of contractual instruments that addressed these risks for each stakeholder under both the public-write and permissioned write models. Unfortunately, this effort resulted in a greater degree of complexity to the governance framework. It also yielded an increase in costs for Stewards that need to comply with a broader set of technical and operational requirements. One approach to reducing the complexity of governance policies was to transition the existing Sovrin Network (DID Ledger) into a dedicated ledger for public write access and then add a new DID Ledger that would operate under a separate governance model for permissioned writes. Token-free Economics \u00b6 The Sovrin Foundation spent a huge amount of money investing in a new Governance Framework that favors the use of a crypto-token to enable a payment model for public-write interactions with a DID Ledger. The combination of public write access coupled with the conveniences of a payment token would open identity access up to a very diverse community that is currently unable to establish a trusted identity reputation. While the social benefits of such an approach are appealing to many, the ability for many enterprises and some governments to embrace the use of crypto-tokens in the first half of 2020 was limiting. The community needed to explore a compromise which allowed two market segments to coexist. We needed to establish a community bound to a common vision but comprised of safe-spaces for each segment to establish their own governance. Common Ground \u00b6 The pathway to a common vision for decentralized identity has always been rooted in open standards and open source communities. As a community, we agree on: an Open by Design approach based on open standards avoidance of with any deviation from an open approach at the technology or governance levels the need to support a network of networks model that enables disparate market segments to deploy different governance Fundamentally, no single organization can own a network (system of ledgers) and the network must be built upon open standards and protocols where interoperability has been achieved. Transition \u00b6 In March 2020, the Sovrin Foundation's ongoing attempts to serve multiple disparate market segments under a single governance framework came to an abrupt halt when financial constraints finally triggered the need for a change. The ToIP Foundation offered all community stakeholders the flexibility to establish one or more Identity Utility Networks that can serve the needs of the diverse segments of the Sovrin Community and beyond. Digital Trust Marketplace \u00b6 As the proliferation of decentralized identity utility networks continued to increase, the global identity industry needed a way to categorize and position independent networks for discovery, access and trust. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation addressed this growing need by establishing a collaborative community that frames the technology and governance infrastructure necessary to support an interoperable digital trust marketplace . In collaboration with ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group , organizations can establish independent self-governed and self-sustainable public utilities, at layer one of ToIP Architecture. This architecture establishes human trust between peers\u2014trust between real-world individuals and organizations and the things with which they interact (devices, sensors, appliances, vehicles, buildings, cities, etc.). The ToIP Architecture is technology agnostic, allowing solutions to be constructed using open building blocks (standards, specs and code) and provides a complete architecture for Internet-scale transitive trust that integrates cryptographic verifiability at the technical machine layer with human trust at the business, social, and legal layers.","title":"Transition"},{"location":"archive/transition/#global-growth","text":"The Sovrin Foundation entered into the decentralized identity market as a permissioned public ledger.

Businesses and Governments around the world must be able to balance risk mitigation and technology adoption if Sovrin was to be an open community for all. Additionally, all stakeholders must accept the fact that a single network (DID ledger) cannot serve the entire globe. As an example, the Sovrin Network was based on Hyperledger Indy, which like many consensus algorithms, carries an expected threshold of optimal validator nodes, thereby limiting the scalability of a single network. The decentralized identity community cannot afford to have disputes at the network level. We must focus on market creation not market bifurcation. We live in a heterogeneous world of networks where interoperability is paramount. A single network cannot meet the needs of everyone and continued attempts to do so will minimally yield increased complexity and confusion. These facts became reality within the Sovrin Foundation as it became difficult to obtain closure after nearly a year on Version 2 of the Sovrin Governance Framework. The Sovrin Foundation was in gridlock throughout all of 2019 due to apprehension between policy decisions that were necessary for one market segment and uncomfortable for another. These concerns impacted the business market segment as well as external coalitions such as FINDY and KIVA who may have desired to have their own governance framework while participating in the Sovrin Community. One approach to breaking the gridlock while still enabling two market segments to co-exist was to establish a community bound to a common vision but comprised of safe-spaces for each segment to establish their own governance.","title":"Policy Gridlock"},{"location":"archive/transition/#permissioned-safe-zone","text":"Preventive measures for avoiding the possible insertion of personal data into an immutable ledger has been the focus of much discussion. While many have agreed that a 100% guarantee is not possible, the implementation of a public write model only increases such exposure thereby making interested stakeholders more apprehensive to embrace a permission-less governance model. A diligent effort was made within the Sovrin Foundation to address the regulatory risks (i.e.: CCPA, GDPR) associated community stakeholders. In collaboration with legal experts, the community established a series of contractual instruments that addressed these risks for each stakeholder under both the public-write and permissioned write models. Unfortunately, this effort resulted in a greater degree of complexity to the governance framework. It also yielded an increase in costs for Stewards that need to comply with a broader set of technical and operational requirements. One approach to reducing the complexity of governance policies was to transition the existing Sovrin Network (DID Ledger) into a dedicated ledger for public write access and then add a new DID Ledger that would operate under a separate governance model for permissioned writes.","title":"Permissioned Safe Zone"},{"location":"archive/transition/#token-free-economics","text":"The Sovrin Foundation spent a huge amount of money investing in a new Governance Framework that favors the use of a crypto-token to enable a payment model for public-write interactions with a DID Ledger.

While the social benefits of such an approach are appealing to many, the ability for many enterprises and some governments to embrace the use of crypto-tokens in the first half of 2020 was limiting.

Users of the CCNU, namely Holders, Issuers and Verifiers of digital credentials, expect a level of assurance pertaining to the reliability and integrity of the ledger. Those users who are members of the Canadian Credential Network have a vested interest understanding the level of assurance that can be assigned to the CCNU. Those users who seek public read-only access for verification purposes also desire an understanding the level of assurance to help set business verification polices but they do not have a stake in the network. Assurance Requirements \u00b6 The CCNU aspires to ensure reliability, low processing latency, and a maximum uptime of the service. The Level of Assurance that can be asserted by the CCNU Governance Framework will evolve over time depending on a number of factors including: Member Compliance Adherence to technical and operating policies operating policies Contract status Ledger Reliability Probability that verification requests (ledger reads) will operate without failure for a specified number of transactions or for a specified period of time and within an acceptable response-time. Probability that transaction author requests (ledger writes) will operate without failure for a specified number of transactions or for a specified period of time and within an acceptable response-time. Ecosystem Trust Factor As the CCNU matures towards a production ready and actively used ledger, the degree of assurance measures that will be in place will vary. Pre-Production Phase \u00b6 No assurances for public use (read transactions). Membership status will be public through Canadian Credential Network website. Early Production Phase \u00b6 No assurances for public use (read transactions). Membership status will be public through Canadian Credential Network website.

Versioning \u00b6 Each version of this document is tied to the CCNU Governance Framework at a specific point of time. Terminology \u00b6 All terms in First Letter Capitals that are not defined in this document (as called out in a specific section) are defined in the Glossary . Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of the CCNU Trust Assurance Framework is to identify: The Trust Elements that Trust Actors assert in relationship to the CCNU. The CCNU Roles that assert and rely upon trust. Generally-Accepted, Canacred-Specific, or Domain-Specific Trust Criteria used in the evaluation of trust associated with the CCNU. The Trust Assertions that CCNU Roles make against Trust Criteria. The Trust Evidence that Trust Actors produce to create assurance regarding their trust assertions. The Trust Mechanisms in place to assert and evaluate trust. The process of Trust Governance whereby trust assertions are evaluated and deemed trustworthy, so they can be relied upon by Relying Parties (CCNU Consumers). Level of Assurance \u00b6 This document describes the Level of Assurance a Relying Party can derive from the CCNU Governance Framework. This section defines the maximum level. The CCNU Governance Framework claims a maximum level of a reasonable Level of Assurance. In May 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)updated its Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (the original framework). The original framework has gained broad acceptance and is widely used around the world. It is recognized as a leading framework for designing, implementing, and conducting internal control and assessing the effectiveness of internal control. Internal control is defined as follows: Internal control is a process, effected by an entity\u2019s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. This definition reflects certain fundamental concepts. Internal control is: Geared to the achievement of objectives in one or more categories\u2014operations, reporting, and compliance A process consisting of ongoing tasks and activities \u2014 a means to an end, not an end in itself Effected by people \u2014 not merely about policy and procedure manuals, systems, and forms, but about people and the actions they take at every level of an organization to affect internal control Able to provide reasonable assurance \u2014 but not absolute assurance, to an entity\u2019s senior management and board of directors Adaptable to the entity structure \u2014 flexible in application for the entire entity or for a particular subsidiary, division, operating unit, or business process. This definition is intentionally broad. It captures important concepts fundamental to how organizations design, implement, and conduct internal control, providing a basis for application across organizations that operate in different entity structures, industries, and geographic regions. The ICAEW definition of a reasonable assurance audit engagement is: Where the practitioner needs to reduce the assurance engagement risk (the risk that an inappropriate conclusion is expressed when the information on the subject matter is materially misstated) to an acceptably low level as the basis for a positive form of expression of the practitioner\u2019s conclusion. Such risk is never reduced to nil and therefore, there can never be absolute assurance. Per the ICAEW guidance on management of risk and liability, relying parties may perceive less than reasonable assurance based on their evaluation of the CCNU Governance Framework and the CCNU Trust AssuranceFramework but not more. Trust Elements \u00b6 The following Trust Elements guide the development of specific Trust Criteria asserted by Trust Actors in the CCNU. These are based on the AICPA Trust Services Criteria based on COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework, for use in attestation or consulting engagements to evaluate and report on controls over information and systems (a) across an entire entity; (b) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; (c) within a function relevant to the entity's operational, reporting, or compliance objectives; or (d) for a particular type of information used by the entity. Security. Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of information, and damage to systems that could compromise the availability, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information or systems and affect the entity\u2019s ability to meet its objectives. Availability. Information and systems are available for operation and used to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Processing integrity. System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Confidentiality. Information designated as confidential is protected to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Privacy. Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. CCNU Roles Making Trust Assertions \u00b6 The following CCNU Roles make Trust Assertions with regard to the Trust Elements to Relying Parties within the Canacred Community: Canadian Credential Network (including the Governing Board). Steward. Trust Criteria \u00b6 Canacred-Specific Trust Criteria \u00b6 For the CCNU Governance Framework, the only Trust Criteria in operation are self-developed by the Canadian Credential Network and appear in section 10 and in an Addendum to that document. It comprises governance Policies the Canadian Credential Network has set for itself and the Canacred Member Business Policies and Canacred Member Technical Policies it mandates for Stewards. Trust Evidence \u00b6 Trust assertions are empty without evidence to support it. The following are examples of Trust Evidence that are used to support Trust Assertions for the CCNU Governance Framework. Signed Contracts. Signed Agreements. Configurations. Signed Approvals. Policies. Procedures. Logs. a. Security. b. Application. c. System. d. Database. Incident Records \u00b6 For the CCNU Governance Framework, see the Trust Assurance Matrix (Addendum) for the specific Trust Evidence used in this version of the CCNU Trust Assurance Framework.

Canadian Credential Network Trust Criteria Compliance b. Legal Compliance Trust Governance \u00b6 The following is a graphical and procedural depiction on how trust asserted from CCNU Roles are currently received, assessed, and relied upon in the CCNU. For the CCNU Governance Framework: The Canacred Governing Board has established the CCNU Governance Framework and this CCNU Trust Assurance Framework. It has created its own Policies and those it requires of Stewards in their Role within the CCNU. The Canacred Governing Board requires members to sign the contractual instruments and perform Self-Certification that the member is compliant with the Canacred Member Business Policies and Canacred Member Technical Policies . This Self-Certification is reviewed by the responsible Canacred Governing Body and reported to the Canacred Governing Board prior to approval of the Steward. Trust Assurance Matrix \u00b6 The CCNU Trust Assurance Matrix is a tabbed spreadsheet which correlates existing CCNU Governance Framework Policy statements across CCNU Governance Framework documents and relevant stakeholders. This matrix is the foundation of self and third-party audits needed to verify compliance to the CCNU Governance Framework. \u00a9 2020 by Canadian Credential Network.

Number of Directors The board shall consist of the number of directors specified in the articles. If the articles provide for a minimum and maximum number of directors, the board shall be comprised of the fixed number of directors as determined from time to time by the members by ordinary resolution or, if the ordinary resolution empowers the directors to determine the number, by resolution of the board.

Notice of an adjourned meeting is not required if the time and place of the adjourned meeting is announced at the original meeting. Unless the by-law otherwise provides, no notice of meeting need specify the purpose or the business to be transacted at the meeting except that a notice of meeting of directors shall specify any matter referred to in subsection 138(2) (Limits on Authority) of the Act that is to be dealt with at the meeting. 26.

Two or more offices may be held by the same person. 28. Dispute Resolution Mechanism In the event that a dispute or controversy among members, directors, officers, committee members or volunteers of the Corporation arising out of or related to the articles or by-laws, or out of any aspect of the operations of the Corporation is not resolved in private meetings between the parties then without prejudice to or in any other way derogating from the rights of the members, directors, officers, committee members, employees or volunteers of the Corporation as set out in the articles, by-laws or the Act, and as an alternative to such person instituting a law suit or legal action, such dispute or controversy shall be settled by a process of dispute resolution as follows: a. The dispute or controversy shall first be submitted to a panel of mediators whereby the one party appoints one mediator, the other party (or if applicable the board of the Corporation) appoints one mediator, and the two mediators so appointed jointly appoint a third mediator. The three mediators will then meet with the parties in question in an attempt to mediate a resolution between the parties. b. The number of mediators may be reduced from three to one or two upon agreement of the parties. c. If the parties are not successful in resolving the dispute through mediation, then the parties agree that the dispute shall be settled by arbitration before a single arbitrator, who shall not be any one of the mediators referred to above, in accordance with the provincial or territorial legislation governing domestic arbitrations in force in the province or territory where the registered office of the Corporation is situated or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties to the dispute. The parties agree that all proceedings relating to arbitration shall be kept confidential and there shall be no disclosure of any kind. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and shall not be subject to appeal on a question of fact, law or mixed fact and law. All costs of the mediators appointed in accordance with this section shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute or the controversy. All costs of the arbitrators appointed in accordance with this section shall be borne by such parties as may be determined by the arbitrators. 29. By-laws and Effective Date Subject to the articles, the board of directors may, by resolution, make, amend or repeal any by-laws that regulate the activities or affairs of the Corporation. Any such by-law, amendment or repeal shall be effective from the date of the resolution of directors until the next meeting of members where it may be confirmed, rejected or amended by the members by ordinary resolution. If the by-law, amendment or repeal is confirmed or confirmed as amended by the members it remains effective in the form in which it was confirmed. The by-law, amendment or repeal ceases to have effect if it is not submitted to the members at the next meeting of members or if it is rejected by the members at the meeting. This section does not apply to a by-law that requires a special resolution of the members according to subsection 197(1) (fundamental change) of the Act because such by-law amendments or repeals are only effective when confirmed by members.","title":"Canacred Network Bylaws"},{"location":"gf_controlled/by_laws/#canadian-credential-network-constitution","text":"The Canadian Credential Network Charter, as represented in \"Exhibit B\" of the Canadian Credential Network Participation Agreement , describes the charter of the Canadian Credential Network .","title":"Canadian Credential Network Constitution"},{"location":"gf_controlled/by_laws/#the-canadian-credential-network-constitution","text":"Effective [January 01, 2021] Canadian Credential Network (the \"Corporation\") BE IT ENACTED as a by-law of the Corporation as follows: 1.

Document Name Canadian Credential Network Ledger Access Policies Version v0.9 Approval Date Status Pre-Launch Phase: Governance Framework Development Governs Policies for reading and writing to the Canadian Credential Network Utility Governed By Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework Workgroup 1. Declaration of Intent \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network Utility (the \"Utility\") will operate with limited write access as specified by the Permissioned Write Access processing section declared herein. The scope of these policies pertains to the full corpus of Utility Environments , namely all the ledgers associated with the Canadian Credential Network Utility (i.e.: prod, test, dev). 2. Recommended Reading \u00b6 The terms used in this Controlled Document are more fully explained in the Glossary , as well as in the Legal Architecture Overview which includes a visual diagram. One topic pertinent to ledger access is the concept of a Tombstone . A Steward MAY, for regulatory or individual business requirements, determine that it needs to forbid access to a ledger entry and therefore require the ability to mark the subject entry as \"deleted\". While the Canadian Credential Network has taken action to minimize such risk by prohibiting public write access, a Tombstone provides an added protection mechanism that will help mitigate risk for Stewards who are contractually obligated to carry out read and write transactions. The Utility will allow for Tombstones once this feature is implemented in Hyperledger Indy . The Canadian Credential Network will collaborate with the Hyperledger Indy Community and the Canacred Wallet Project (the \"Wallet Project\") to allow a Steward to: Mark a Transaction as \"deleted\" thereby suggesting it should no longer be returned in response to requests for read access. Declare a Transaction as \"deleted\" under one of two categories: Node-Specific Tombstone or a Ledger-Wide Tombstone . Tombstones do not modify data on the ledger. Instead they impact the behavior of a Steward Node that serves data from the ledger. In the general, a Tombstone MAY be used by a Steward that is forced to comply with a legal demand to stop returning a specific Transaction, such as a Transaction containing data that is locally considered Personal Data or that is illegal or violates the Transaction Author Agreement in some other way. In such a case, other Stewards may not face the same legal demands and may take different action. 1. Transaction Author Agreement \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network MUST: Publish a Transaction Author Agreement between a Transaction Author and the Canadian Credential Network (representing the Canadian Credential Network Utility as a whole) specifying the terms and conditions under which Transaction Authors agree to submit write Transactions to the Utility, including the policies defined in this Controlled Document. Publish a Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifying the requirements for a Steward to serve as a Data Processor on behalf of Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the Canadian Credential Network as a Designated Data Controller. When necessary, revise the Transaction Author Agreement and the Steward DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as specified in the Governance section of the Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework Master Document. Maintain a published version of the Transaction Author Agreement and the Steward DPA in the Canadian Credential Network Code Repository . A Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit Transactions that contain: Data that would violate the intellectual property rights of others. Data that may not lawfully be written to the Utility, where the definition of applicable law in this context is provided in the Transaction Author Agreement. A Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit a Transaction that contains Personal Data. A Transaction Author MUST agree that if it is determined in a court of law that one or more Transactions made by the Transaction Author violated the terms and conditions of the Transaction Author Agreement, the Transaction Author consents to the marking of those Transactions with a Tombstone and, if possible, the revocation of the State Proof(s) pertaining to the Utility data for those Transactions. 2. Transaction Endorser Agreement \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network MUST: Publish a Transaction Endorser Agreement between the Transaction Endorser and the Canadian Credential Network specifying the terms and conditions under which Transaction Endorsers agree to write Transactions to the Utility, including the policies defined in this Controlled Document. Publish a Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifying the requirements for a Transaction Endorser to serve as a Data Processor on behalf of Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the Canadian Credential Network as a Designated Data Controller. When necessary, revise the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as specified in the Governance section of the Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework Master Document. Publish the current version of the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser DPA in the Canadian Credential Network Code Repository . A Transaction Endorser MUST adhere to membership entitlements that constrain the number of transactions that may be submitted as specified in the Transaction Endorser Agreement. A Transaction Endorser MUST: Only submit Transactions from Transaction Authors who have explicitly agreed to the Transaction Author Agreement by physically signing a copy. Maintain physical or digital evidence of conformance to this policy. 3. Permissioned Write Access \u00b6 The scope of the policies defined in this section is defined as follows: The policies in this section MUST apply to all Utility Environments. The policies governing write access to non-production Utility Environments (i.e.: Dev, Test) MAY be defined separately by other Controlled Documents. Canadian Credential Network Trustees are permitted to write Transactions to the Utility under the following rules: This policy MUST apply only to Trustees acting in their role as Trustees of the Canadian Credential Network. A Trustee MUST only make the following Transactions if the Transaction has been approved by a motion of the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors. Add or remove a Trustee. Add or remove a Steward. Add or remove a Transaction Endorser. Update or receive updates from the Membership Management System. A Trustee MAY make Utility maintenance Transactions if the Transaction is approved by either the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors. Canadian Credential Network members who are permitted to serve in the role of Transaction Endorsers MUST agree to the Transaction Endorser Agreement by submitting a physically or digitally signed copy to the Canadian Credential Network. Transaction Authors are permitted to write Transactions to the Utility provided:: Each Transaction includes a valid digital signature from the Transaction Author. The Transaction is endorsed by an approved Transaction Endorser. If the Transaction updates the state of a ledger-persisted data structure, it MUST be digitally signed by the same Transaction Author that recorded the previous state. 4. Public Write Access \u00b6 Public Write Access is PROHIBITED. All Utility Environments MUST adhere to Permissioned Write Access processing. 5. Public Read Access \u00b6 The Utility MUST be publicly available for anyone to submit read transactions. Stewards MUST provide public read access without cost for all Transactions on the Utility unless marked by a Tombstone. Once Tombstone functionality has been: implemented by the underlying ledger technology, approved by the Bedrock Technical Steering Committee, and approved by the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors, a Steward MAY mark a Transaction as a Node-Specific Tombstone if: Requested by the Transaction Author of a Transaction for a valid reason as specified by the Transaction Author Agreement. Required of the Steward by a court order. The Steward has evidence that the Transaction violates the terms and conditions of the Transaction Author Agreement. A Steward MUST NOT use a Node-Specific Tombstone for any other reason. Ledger-Wide Tombstones MUST NOT be implemented until policies governing their usage are published in a future version of this Controlled Document.

One topic pertinent to ledger access is the concept of a Tombstone . A Steward MAY, for regulatory or individual business requirements, determine that it needs to forbid access to a ledger entry and therefore require the ability to mark the subject entry as \"deleted\". While the Canadian Credential Network has taken action to minimize such risk by prohibiting public write access, a Tombstone provides an added protection mechanism that will help mitigate risk for Stewards who are contractually obligated to carry out read and write transactions. The Utility will allow for Tombstones once this feature is implemented in Hyperledger Indy . The Canadian Credential Network will collaborate with the Hyperledger Indy Community and the Canacred Wallet Project (the \"Wallet Project\") to allow a Steward to: Mark a Transaction as \"deleted\" thereby suggesting it should no longer be returned in response to requests for read access. Declare a Transaction as \"deleted\" under one of two categories: Node-Specific Tombstone or a Ledger-Wide Tombstone . Tombstones do not modify data on the ledger. Instead they impact the behavior of a Steward Node that serves data from the ledger. In the general, a Tombstone MAY be used by a Steward that is forced to comply with a legal demand to stop returning a specific Transaction, such as a Transaction containing data that is locally considered Personal Data or that is illegal or violates the Transaction Author Agreement in some other way. In such a case, other Stewards may not face the same legal demands and may take different action.","title":"2.

Document Name Steward Technical and Organizational Policies Version v0.9 Approval Date Status Pre-Launch Phase: Governance Framework Development Governs General Security Policies, Node Technical Policies, General Security Policies, Node Security Policies, Operating Policies, Node Selection Algorithm, Permissioned Test Network Policies, Reporting Policies Governed By Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework Work Group, Bedrock Technical Steering Committee 1. Ledger Software Policies \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors MUST decide the software technology and version used by all Nodes (Validator, Observer). This software is referred to as the Bedrock Open Source Code . The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors MUST require the TSC to establish best practices for continuous delivery and integration of the Bedrock Open Source Code using containerization. The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors MUST require the TSC and/or the Utility Service Provider to deploy an upgrade notification process that will allow Stewards to automatically recognized and act when upgrades are available. The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors MAY leverage the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) or another 3rd party service to maintain a version of the Bedrock Open Source Code. The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors SHOULD require the TSC and/or the Utility Service Provider to automate any prescribed tools that are expected to be used by a node. The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors MUST require the TSC and/or the Utility Service Provider to clearly articulate the mechanism by which a Steward schedules and communicates downtime. The Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors SHOULD require the TSC and the Utility Service Provider to RECOMMEND that Stewards use the Hyperledger Blockchain Automation Framework (BAF) when standing up their Steward node if they are not going to procure Node-aaS from a Hosting Provider. BAF provides a consistent delivery/ deployment architecture to standup up and maintain a single Hyperledger Indy node for a Steward. 2. General Security Policies \u00b6 A Steward MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral to maintaining protection of all services provided in association with the Participation Agreement (\u201cMember Services\u201d). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the Steward involved with providing the Member Services. The Steward shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and compliance enforcement. A Steward MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies as the Steward deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Member Services. Because Node administrators are a potential threat vector, a Steward MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Member Services and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Member Services. In accordance with the Steward's internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Steward. Each Steward company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under local law. Employees of a Steward involved with providing its Member Services MUST complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with the Steward's ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the Steward's operation and support of its Member Services. If a Steward hosts its Node in its own data center, the Steward's security policies MUST also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best practices. If the Steward hosts its Node using a third-party Hosting Provider, the Steward MUST ensure that the security, privacy, and data protection policies of the Hosting Provider meet the requirements in this document. A Steward MUST make available to the Canadian Credential Network upon request evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the Steward, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards. 3. General Node Policies \u00b6 A Steward Node: MUST be available to run as a Validator Node or Observer Node on any of the formal ledgers associated with the Utility environments (i.e.: prod, stage, dev) MUST run a release of the Bedrock Open Source Code that has been approved and designated by the Bedrock Board of Directors and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). MUST facilitate an upgrade to a new version of the Bedrock Open Source Code within three (3) business days of a new release that has been: recommended by the TSC, and accepted by the Canadian Credential Network. MUST register all Node configuration data in a timely manner and keep information up to date within three (3) business days of changes. MUST have at least two (2) IT-qualified persons assigned to administer the node, and at least one other person that has adequate access and training to administer the Node in an emergency, such as the network being unable to reach consensus or being under attack. See the TSC regarding specific Crisis Management Plan details. See Issue 23 . MUST supply contact info for all administrators to the Canadian Credential Network, whose accuracy is tested at least quarterly (e.g., by acknowledging the receipt of an email or text within 24hrs). MUST recover the system from failure in one hour or less. 4. Node Technical Policies \u00b6 For all ledgers within the Utility environments list, the following requirements apply to Nodes on the prod instance of the Utility. These requirements may be downgraded from MUST to SHOULD for any Nodes on ledgers that are for non-production purposes. MUST run on robust server-class hardware. If a Node is run on a VM, the Steward: MUST run on a mainstream hypervisor that receives timely patches from its vendor or community. SHOULD apply hypervisor patches on a regular basis. The Node MUST run in an OS that is dedicated to the validator, i.e., a single-purpose (physical or virtual) machine that MUST run Bedrock Open Source Code, MAY run other software approved by the TSC, and MUST NOT run any other software. Software required to support the node, such as monitoring, backup, and configuration management software, are approved as a general category. However, Stewards should discuss with the TSC any software packages that transmit between the Steward Node and the outside. MUST run a server with compatible versions of the operating systems supported by the Hyperledger Indy Node requirements as documented in the release notes. MUST have adequate compute power (in late 2020, 8 or more cores is considered adequate). MUST have adequate RAM (in late 2020, 32 GB of RAM is considered adequate). MUST have at least 1 TB, with the ability to grow to 2 TB, of reliable (e.g., RAIDed) disk space, with an adequately sized boot partition. MUST have a high-speed connection to the internet with highly available, redundant pipes (as of late 2020, 100 Mbps was considered adequate). MUST have the following dedicated NICs: a public NIC for all Validator-to-Validator consensus traffic that is a stable, static, world-routable IP address. a private NIC for all CLI-to-Validator traffic MUST prevent traffic originating from the Validator node to reach the Validator's intranet domain. MUST be implemented in a way that does not endanger Bedrock's high availability architecture, which is pool-based rather than node-based. Nodes should not take more responsibility for high availability than what is contemplated by the Node Selection Algorithm. For example, they should listen at exactly one pair of network addresses (see 3.9 above), using exactly one set of keys to respond to BBU/Indy protocol traffic at any one time, and adhere to a minimal failover recovery delay period specified by the Canadian Credential Network (or 30 seconds if not specified). MUST have a system clock that is demonstrably in sync with well-known NTP servers. SHOULD have a power supply consistent with high availability systems. 5. Node Security Policies \u00b6 A Steward: MUST maintain its CLI Private Key on a separate machine from the machine that runs their node. This machine, called the \u201cCLI (Command Line Interface) system\u201d, uses the CLI Private Key to authorize the Node to participate in the pool, and is thus the basis for trust for the node and the Steward's identity on the network. The CLI system is not required to have high-end hardware, but in terms of IT best practices for security, it must meet or exceed the standards for the Node (see following items). MUST provide certification that their Node runs in a locked datacenter with appropriate levels of security, including the specifications that they target (e.g., SSAE 16 type II compliance; other standards may also be acceptable). MUST assert that their Node is isolated from internal systems of a Steward (because the Validator Node is publicly visible and thus an inappropriate candidate for access to privileged internal networks). MUST assert that their Node, and its underlying systems, uses state-of-the-art authentication for remote access via SSH with key plus password plus source IP firewall rule. SHOULD implement two-factor authentication for SSH access. MUST NOT allow access (remote or local) to the Node or CLI systems by anyone other than assigned admins. MUST apply the latest security patches within one (1) week or less (24 hours or less is recommended). MUST attest that the Node runs on a server protected by a firewall that, at minimum: Disallows public ingress except on ports used by the Node software (different machines may choose to expose ledger features on different ports, so no standard port setup is required). Optionally enables SSH, Remote Desktop, and similar remote access tools but constrains ingress for these tools in some way that excludes the public but allows access for admins. Locks down egress ports to limit the ability to jump from Node to some other location. MUST run a set of TSC prescribed tools and receive TSC approval of the results before the Node is authorized to participate in consensus. MUST run a set of TSC prescribed tools from time to time as requested by the TSC and provide the test results report to the TSC within three (3) business days. See Issue 24 . 6. Node Operating Policies \u00b6 A Steward: MUST equip at least two (2) technical points of contact responsible for administering the Steward Node with an SMS-capable device for alerting. SHOULD aim to achieve at least 99.9% (three nines) uptime for their Node (this amounts to about 1.4 minutes of downtime per day or 9 hours per year). SHOULD coordinate downtime with other Stewards in advance via a mechanism as determined from time to time by agreement between the TSC and any other relevant Canadian Credential Network Governing Body. 7. Node Selection Algorithm \u00b6 The TSC will take direction from the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors, or a designated Canadian Credential Network Workgroup, regarding the configuration parameters associated with the deployment of the Node Selection Algorithm. The selection of active Validator Nodes at any point in time, at least on the BBU, MUST be governed by the Node Selection Algorithm. Non-technical inputs or policy decisions implemented by the Node Selection Algorithm MUST be approved by the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors. At any point in time, the Node Selection Algorithm MUST represent the TSC\u2019s best efforts at designing an algorithm that applies the Core Principles of the Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework. Recognizing the inherent tension and tradeoffs between some of the Core Principles, the design of this algorithm should give priority to balancing: The Decentralization by Design principles, in particular the principles of Diffuse Trust and High Availability. See Diversity Goals below. The Security by Design principles, in particular the principles of System Diversity and Secure Failure. See Diversity Goals below. A human-readable, understandable, and explainable description of the current design of the algorithm as approved by the TSC MUST be published by the TSC in the official Canadian Credential Network Foundation Code Repository and made visible to all Stewards via a web page on the Canadian Credential Network website. 8. Reporting Policies \u00b6 A Steward MUST report to the responsible Canadian Credential Network Governing Body any substantive change to the configuration or location of a Node within five (5) business days of the change. 9. Diversity Goals \u00b6 While the Node Selection Algorithm will be tuned from time-to-time to address Performance as well as Decentralization Security by Design principles, the following diversity guidelines SHOULD be considered: Concern Policy Should restrictions be applied that limit the number of nodes in the active Validator Pool that are hosted in a specific data center? See IaaS Policy Should restrictions be applied that limit the number of nodes in the active Validator Pool that are hosted in a specific geolocation? See IaaS Policy Should restrictions be applied that limit the number of nodes in the active Validator Pool that can be hosted on the same IaaS? YES - See IaaS Policy Should restrictions be applied that limit the number of nodes in the active Validator Pool that can be hosted by the same hosting provider? NO - See Hosting Provider Policy IaaS Policy \u00b6 If a Steward desires to take on the compliance costs for in-house hosting certification, this will add diversity to the Utility. Some Stewards MAY desire to meet the needs of their membership obligations using external cloud providers that offer the necessary security and compliance certifications and offers world-wide data center coverage. The following SHOULD be considered when Stewards leverage any form of outsourced cloud computing ( Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) , Software as a service (SaaS) , or Platform as a service (PaaS) ): In 2019, Gartner listed the following top 6 global enterprise cloud providers: AWS, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, Oracle and IBM. These providers have the ability to meet two key requirements for Stewards: Standards compliance and certification; Many (>15) availability zones across numerous (>5) geographic regions. There is no simple way to determine the appropriate degree of granularity relative to geolocation restrictions. Instead, limits SHOULD be applied to the number of nodes across availability zones within a particular IaaS. No more that 10% of total Active Validator Pool SHOULD be hosted in the same availability zones of an IaaS. Assuming an Active Validator Pool of 25, this would be no more than 2 nodes on any given availability zone for an IaaS. To minimize the impact IaaS vulnerabilities may have on consensus, no more than 33% of the Active Validator Pool should be running on a specific IaaS. Assuming an Active Validator Pool of 25, this would imply that no more than 8 nodes should be hosted on any one IaaS. Hosting Provider Policy \u00b6 The relationship between a Steward and a Hosting Provider is outside the scope of the BBU-GF. Hosting provider decisions have financial impacts on Stewards and as a result the Consortium SHOULD NOT insert itself into that decision making process. While no restrictions are suggested, a Steward SHOULD expect hosting providers to offer multi-cloud hosting options for Indy-Node SaaS services so that IaaS policies can be observed across the BBU.","title":"Steward Technical and Organizational Policies"},{"location":"gf_controlled/member_top/#steward-technical-and-organizational-policies","text":"This is a Controlled Document of the Canadian Credential Network Governance Framework was approved by the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors.

Over this time we have experienced technology advances in moving from simple and low strength username/password mechanisms to strong cryptographic and biometric authentication techniques, most recently facilitated by the almost universal adoption of smartphones. At the same time, we have seen the evolution of solutions from single service authentication systems (modelled on solutions designed for enterprise internal systems) to shared (or federated) authentication solutions using internet standard protocols such as SAML, Oauth 2.0, and OpenID Connect. Many Canadians are familiar with using their Google and Facebook accounts to access other provider\u2019s services, thereby reducing the number of username/passwords they need to manage. In Canada, notable shared solutions in use by governments include the Concierge solution adopted by the Government of Canada and the BC Services Card solution available to all British Columbians. Most recently there has been significant development of blockchain based identity solutions that build upon the preceding technologies and promise to provide enhanced user experience, security, privacy, and utility for both service providers and their users. A key aspect of these new solutions is the presence of a digital software application held by the user, typically on their smartphone, that acts as a secure container for the user\u2019s identity information, delivering both a strong authentication solution and provider of verifiable identity information (or credentials). It is this software application that many are referring to as the Digital Wallet. DIACC has made excellent progress in developing standards and practices with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework\u2122 (PCTF). However the PCTF does not directly address the implementation specific requirements for a trustworthy Digital Identity Wallet component. In this new architecture it is critical that the digital identity wallet is indeed trustworthy and that Canadians are protected and know which digital identity wallets they can safely use. Service providers and relying parties in turn need to know that the information they manage is protected by digital identity wallet solutions. Of urgent concern is the development of a set of principles to underscore the need for security, privacy, and interoperability of these digital identity wallets. Without these guiding principles, there is great risk that wallet providers will deem it acceptable to sacrifice the areas of concern addressed by the principles for expediency or for business models that are detrimental to the wallet holders. The lack of these guiding principles may result in slower adoption of the networks that the wallets are supporting. At the June 2020 DIACC Innovation Expert Committee meeting, it was proposed and accepted that a working group develop a draft Digital Identity Wallet Principles for review. This is a set of durable and high level principles for security, privacy, interoperability, agency and other aspects. These principles will need to be sufficiently high level that they will stand the test of time in supporting innovation and various business models but will also ensure that the needs of Canadians, Canadian businesses, and the public sector are met. Digital Identity Wallet \u00b6 For the purpose of these principles, we define an identity wallet as an application that is used by an individual to hold and present their identity information. Identity might not be the sole purpose of the application, any application that provides identity services falls under these principles. We do not assume a specific identity network or technology, these principles should cover any existing implementations as well as future approaches to identity. Privacy - A wallet holder must be provided privacy by default. The wallet must be developed with privacy built into the default settings and services. The wallet must ensure that the data and privacy of the wallet holder is protected, from their first point of contact, without the customer having to change any settings. Data Protection - A wallet holder must be provided data security for all data held on their device, in the cloud, in transmission or backed up. All personal data is securely collected, transmitted, processed, stored, and backed up. To protect users\u2019 data from unauthorized disclosure, alteration or use, all data at rest or in transit must be protected using industry standard encryption and security processes. Agency - The wallet holder must be able to act independently and make their own choices. The data belongs to the wallet holder, they must be able to grant consent and be enabled to store, share, edit or remove their data as they see fit. Verifiable - The wallet holder must be able to verify the authenticity of providers, relying parties, networks and the wallet itself. The wallet must provide the holder with full information about any party that the holder may engage in a relationship with. This includes information about the wallet developer and wallet certifications. Portable - The wallet must support standards to give agency to the holder to move their data to another wallet. The wallet cannot exclusively hold private data on the holder. The holder needs to be able to transfer their complete set of data in case of device obsolescence, disruption of service, changes in governance by the wallet developers or other factors that the holder calculates to be against their privacy, loss of agency or on a whim. The mechanisms for portability need to respect the principles already outlined. Interoperability - The wallet should support multiple networks for receiving and verifying identity data. The wallet should not isolate the holder to a single network. The wallet should allow the holder to have identity information that can be used between multiple identity networks where allowed by the networks. Accessibility - The wallet should avoid barriers to access its capabilities. Barriers to access may include financial, internet access (speed and continuity), device capabilities, visual impairments, literacy and interface design. The wallet should conform to W3C accessibility standards for Web Content, User Agents and Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Governance - The wallet must provide information on the developers and governance model used. The wallet needs to specify the organizations or individuals who have developed and published the wallet. It must provide access to any wallet software lifecycle governance, open-source repositories and executed code audits. Transparency - The wallet holder should have access to transparent and verifiable information about the extent to which the wallet complies with the principles 1 through 8. An ideal wallet will adhere to principles 1-8 perfectly. Due to technical limitations, business considerations or legal compliance, the wallet may not be able to comply.

Over this time we have experienced technology advances in moving from simple and low strength username/password mechanisms to strong cryptographic and biometric authentication techniques, most recently facilitated by the almost universal adoption of smartphones. At the same time, we have seen the evolution of solutions from single service authentication systems (modelled on solutions designed for enterprise internal systems) to shared (or federated) authentication solutions using internet standard protocols such as SAML, Oauth 2.0, and OpenID Connect. Many Canadians are familiar with using their Google and Facebook accounts to access other provider\u2019s services, thereby reducing the number of username/passwords they need to manage. In Canada, notable shared solutions in use by governments include the Concierge solution adopted by the Government of Canada and the BC Services Card solution available to all British Columbians. Most recently there has been significant development of blockchain based identity solutions that build upon the preceding technologies and promise to provide enhanced user experience, security, privacy, and utility for both service providers and their users. A key aspect of these new solutions is the presence of a digital software application held by the user, typically on their smartphone, that acts as a secure container for the user\u2019s identity information, delivering both a strong authentication solution and provider of verifiable identity information (or credentials). It is this software application that many are referring to as the Digital Wallet. DIACC has made excellent progress in developing standards and practices with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework\u2122 (PCTF). However the PCTF does not directly address the implementation specific requirements for a trustworthy Digital Identity Wallet component. In this new architecture it is critical that the digital identity wallet is indeed trustworthy and that Canadians are protected and know which digital identity wallets they can safely use. Service providers and relying parties in turn need to know that the information they manage is protected by digital identity wallet solutions. Of urgent concern is the development of a set of principles to underscore the need for security, privacy, and interoperability of these digital identity wallets. Without these guiding principles, there is great risk that wallet providers will deem it acceptable to sacrifice the areas of concern addressed by the principles for expediency or for business models that are detrimental to the wallet holders. The lack of these guiding principles may result in slower adoption of the networks that the wallets are supporting. At the June 2020 DIACC Innovation Expert Committee meeting, it was proposed and accepted that a working group develop a draft Digital Identity Wallet Principles for review. This is a set of durable and high level principles for security, privacy, interoperability, agency and other aspects. These principles will need to be sufficiently high level that they will stand the test of time in supporting innovation and various business models but will also ensure that the needs of Canadians, Canadian businesses, and the public sector are met.","title":"Why do we need a Digital Identity Wallet set of principles?"},{"location":"gf_controlled/wallet%20principles/#digital-identity-wallet","text":"For the purpose of these principles, we define an identity wallet as an application that is used by an individual to hold and present their identity information. Identity might not be the sole purpose of the application, any application that provides identity services falls under these principles. We do not assume a specific identity network or technology, these principles should cover any existing implementations as well as future approaches to identity. Privacy - A wallet holder must be provided privacy by default. The wallet must be developed with privacy built into the default settings and services. The wallet must ensure that the data and privacy of the wallet holder is protected, from their first point of contact, without the customer having to change any settings. Data Protection - A wallet holder must be provided data security for all data held on their device, in the cloud, in transmission or backed up. All personal data is securely collected, transmitted, processed, stored, and backed up. To protect users\u2019 data from unauthorized disclosure, alteration or use, all data at rest or in transit must be protected using industry standard encryption and security processes. Agency - The wallet holder must be able to act independently and make their own choices. The data belongs to the wallet holder, they must be able to grant consent and be enabled to store, share, edit or remove their data as they see fit. Verifiable - The wallet holder must be able to verify the authenticity of providers, relying parties, networks and the wallet itself. The wallet must provide the holder with full information about any party that the holder may engage in a relationship with. This includes information about the wallet developer and wallet certifications. Portable - The wallet must support standards to give agency to the holder to move their data to another wallet. The wallet cannot exclusively hold private data on the holder. The holder needs to be able to transfer their complete set of data in case of device obsolescence, disruption of service, changes in governance by the wallet developers or other factors that the holder calculates to be against their privacy, loss of agency or on a whim. The mechanisms for portability need to respect the principles already outlined. Interoperability - The wallet should support multiple networks for receiving and verifying identity data. The wallet should not isolate the holder to a single network. The wallet should allow the holder to have identity information that can be used between multiple identity networks where allowed by the networks. Accessibility - The wallet should avoid barriers to access its capabilities. Barriers to access may include financial, internet access (speed and continuity), device capabilities, visual impairments, literacy and interface design. The wallet should conform to W3C accessibility standards for Web Content, User Agents and Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Governance - The wallet must provide information on the developers and governance model used. The wallet needs to specify the organizations or individuals who have developed and published the wallet. It must provide access to any wallet software lifecycle governance, open-source repositories and executed code audits. Transparency - The wallet holder should have access to transparent and verifiable information about the extent to which the wallet complies with the principles 1 through 8. An ideal wallet will adhere to principles 1-8 perfectly. Due to technical limitations, business considerations or legal compliance, the wallet may not be able to comply.

While, a non-profit corporation can earn a profit, the profit must be used to further the goals of the corporation rather than to pay dividends to its membership. Identity Utility Networks have specific income and expense characteristics that are addressed by the principles, polices and procedures outlined in their governance frameworks. Expenses Income 1. Node Hosting 4. Consortium Membership 2. Network Operation and Maintenance Services 5. Community Donations 3. Consortium Governance 6. Transaction Revenue Utility Operations \u00b6 Node Hosting \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 The deployment of decentralized identity solution based on distributed ledger technology (i.e.: blockchain ledgers) implies that there will not be a single centralized entity that owns and operates the ledger or the nodes attached to the ledger. The governing body of a distributed ledger owns the responsibly for defining the technology that is used to establish and run the ledger. However, it is the responsibility of each node owner to provide an operational compute node that meets the requirements of the governing body. Fulfillment of the node owner's responsibilities comes at a cost regardless of their decision to mange the node themselves or to pay a hosting provider. Some governing bodies may place diversity requirements on node owners. These requirements may include restrictions such as but not limited to: Number of nodes hosted in a specific data center Number of nodes hosted in a geolocation Number of nodes running on the IaaS Number of nodes hosted by the same hosting provider CCNU Perspective \u00b6 Any member of the Canadian Credential Network Utility that is required to host a utility infrastructure node is considered a Steward and is responsible for the financial demands of hosting a node. Such expenditures are considered out-of-pocket expenses and are not related to the members annual membership obligations. However, the BBU-GF does recognize the infrastructure contributions of Stewards and MUST adjust membership fees accordingly. Stewards MUST adhere to the Member Technical and Organizational Policies set forth in the Controlled Documents of the BBU-GF. Network Operation and Maintenance Services \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 The management of a distributed ledger MUST be administered by skilled personnel that is familiar with: designing, building, testing and deployment of networks based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) maintaining and releasing reliable versions of a DLT onboarding and configuration of nodes monitoring and tuning of Hyperledger Indy networks The governing body of a public identity utility is responsible for hiring in-house or external resources to accomplish these tasks. The cumulative costs of such services have a direct impact on the financial budget for the Utility. The ToIP Foundation recognizes the importance of the services of Utility Service Providers and has established a dedicated Utility Foundry Working Group to aid governing bodies in selection and hiring of such providers. For example, access to proven request-for-proposal (RFP) templates. Typically, a governing body would initiate a bidding process for an annual contract with the necessary service-level-agreements (SLAs). CCNU Perspective \u00b6 The Governing Board of the Canadian Credential Network Utility with advice from the Finance Committee and Technical Steering Committee will hire personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Utility. Consortium Governance \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 The development and maintenance of a governance framework complete with legal instruments is no small task. The governing body of a public identity utility may establish a Governance Framework Working Group to handle the effort internally or the governing body may leverage the services of a Utility Service Provider for all or portions of the effort. The ToIP Foundation recognizes the complexity of this task and has established a dedicated Utility Foundry Working Group to provide templates for governance frameworks along with access to experienced service providers. CCNU Perspective \u00b6 The Governing Board of the Canadian Credential Network Utility leverages the inexpensive volunteer services of its members to form a Governance Framework Working Group that is responsible for the task. Utility Revenue \u00b6 Consortium Membership \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 A public identity utility serves the needs of interested stakeholders by allowing for both read and write transactions. While read transactions are generally publicly accessible and free, write transactions are typically fee-based. Governing bodies can treat write transactions as an entitlement of membership and charge members for participation in the Utility. CCNU Perspective \u00b6 The Governing Board of the Canadian Credential Network Utility publishes a fee schedule for participation in the Utility. These fees are the only guaranteed source of income. Community Donations \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 Meeting budgetary requirements via subsidized donations is not a recommended business model. However, donations are always possible and often welcomed. CCNU Perspective \u00b6 While the Governing Board of the Canadian Credential Network Utility MAY accept donations, such income is not an assumed source of income. Transaction Revenue \u00b6 General Concept \u00b6 Users of a permissioned ledger, known as Transaction Authors, have a desire to submit transactions to the Utility but they may not own the entitlements to perform those writes. The governing body of a public identity utility may charge fees for write access. They may also charge different fees for the different types of data writes allowed to the ledger. Transactional revenue can be accomplished in a number of ways such as but not limited to: Centralized endorser operated by the Utility Utility tax on endorsers who collect directly from Transaction Authors Selling write entitlements to endorsers and/or Transaction Authors CCNU Perspective \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network Utility Governance Framework does not collect revenue from transaction fees. The exchange of payment (value) between the Transaction Endorser and a Transaction Author is out-of-scope . Transaction Endorsers are free to charge any fee they desire for access to their write transaction entitlements.","title":"Business Model"},{"location":"gf_info/business_model_concepts/#utility-operations","text":"","title":"Utility Operations"},{"location":"gf_info/business_model_concepts/#node-hosting","text":"","title":"Node Hosting"},{"location":"gf_info/business_model_concepts/#general-concept","text":"The deployment of decentralized identity solution based on distributed ledger technology (i.e.: blockchain ledgers) implies that there will not be a single centralized entity that owns and operates the ledger or the nodes attached to the ledger.

Minimally, the organization must meet the requirements to be a member of the public identity utility and must operate at least one Node . Node \u00b6 A computer network server running an instance of the code necessary to operate a distributed ledger or blockchain. In the Canadian Credential Network, a Node is operated by a Steward running an instance of the Canacred Open Source Code to maintain the Canacred Network Utility ( or DID Ledger). A Node must be either a Validator Node or an Observer Node. Canacred Open Source Code \u00b6 The computer software that is installed on all Nodes associated with the Canacred Network Utility (CCNU). This code determined by the Canacred Board of Directors. The CCNU adheres to code selection and version guidance provided by the Technical Steering Committee (\"TSC\") of the Canacred Wallet Project. The TSC collaborates within the Hyperledger Indy Project of the Linux Foundation to establish a TSC approved version of Hyperledger Indy within the the Canacred Code Repository managed by the TSC. Canacred Ledger Environments \u00b6 The corpus of DID Ledgers used by the Canadian Credential Network to operate the Canacred Network Utility. For example: prod , test , and dev . DID Namespace \u00b6 Building on URI Standards, the DID Specification allows for both root namespace (did:xxx) and sub-namespace (did:xxx:yyy) conventions. Governing Body \u00b6 An organization or consortium that is responsible for the management of an Identity Utility Network. Backbone Network \u00b6 A distinct system of domain specific ledgers operated by decentralized peer nodes and associated with a DID Namespace. Governed by its own governance framework. See also Identity Utility Network . Peer-Net ( Deprecated ) \u00b6 A distinct system of domain specific ledgers operated by decentralized peer nodes and associated with a DID Namespace. Governed by its own governance framework. See also Backbone Network . Network of Networks \u00b6 A decentralized collection of discoverable and interoperable Identity Utility Networks. The internet is an exemplar of a network of networks structure based on DNS and URI standards. DID Ledger \u00b6 A distinct system of domain specific ledgers operated by decentralized peer nodes and associated with a DID Namespace. See Identity Utility Network (IUN) Identity Utility Network (IUN) \u00b6 A distinct system of domain specific ledgers operated by decentralized peer nodes and associated with a DID Namespace. Preferably built on Hyperledger Indy, this DID Ledger , is governed by an independent governing body and its own governance framework. Due to the overuse of terms such as \"Network\" and \"Ledger\", the term \"Utility\" has been accepted by the Canadian Credential Network to allow for additional clarity. See also Backbone Network . Remote Identity Utility (Remote IUN) \u00b6 An Identity Utility Network associated with a DID Root Namespace that operates under its own Governance Framework. Decentralized DID Namespace Registry (DDNR) \u00b6 Provides registration, discovery, and access for an Identity Utility Network. Identity Utility Administrator \u00b6 See Utility Service Provider Utility Service Provider \u00b6 The provider of operational and maintenance services for an Identity Utility Network. Trustee \u00b6 An Identity Owner entrusted with specific identity control responsibilities by another Identity Owner or with specific governance responsibilities by a Governance Framework. See Recovery Key Trustee Consortium Trustee \u00b6 A Trustee who is a member of the Canadian Credential Network Board of Directors. The trust in Consortium Trustees is bestowed collectively on behalf of all Identity Owners. Key Recovery \u00b6 The process of recovering access to and control of a set of Private Keys\u2014or an entire Wallet\u2014after loss or compromise. Key Recovery is a major focus of the emerging DKMS standard for cryptographic key management. See also Recovery Key. Recovery Key \u00b6 A special Private Key used for purposes of recovering a Wallet after loss or compromise. In the DKMS key management protocol, a Recovery Key may be cryptographically sharded for secret sharing among multiple Trustees.

Version Control \u00b6 Version : 0.2 Governing Board Approval Date : TBD Comments : Ratification of the CCNU-GF will take place upon the formation of the Governing Board (at first meeting). Status : CCNU Governance Framework Working Group is currently developing the CCNU-GF. Acknowledgements \u00b6 \u200bThis document was produced on behalf of the CCNU Governing Board by the CCNU Governance Framework Working Group. Introduction \u00b6 The purpose of the Canadian Credential Network Utility is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted relationship in Canada. The Canadian Credential Network Utility (the \"CCNU-GF\") serves as the constitution for the Canadian Credential Network Utility . It represents an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility Governance Framework under the guidance of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group . The CCNU-GF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards necessary to enable trusted digital relationship based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the CCNU-GF is to address any concerns or risks that Network members may have as Utility participants. For example, compliance with Data Protection Regulations such as the Canada's Privacy Act and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The purpose of the Canadian Credential Network is to administer decentralized governance for Canadian Credential Network Utility. Governance Framework \u00b6 Governance Documents \u00b6 The CCNU-GF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents that collectively form the governance model for the Utility that the Network manages.

The executable BBU Participation Agreement (the \"Participation Agreement\"), specifically Exhibit B and Exhibit C , supersedes this content. Utility Infrastructure Requirements \u00b6 The Utility is an instance of a ToIP Layer One Public Utility based on Hyperledger Indy (\"Indy\"). In order to establish an operational budget for the Utility, several infrastructure assumptions must be considered. Budgetary requirements dictate how much revenue is required to keep the Utility sustainable. Distributed ledger technologies, like Indy, leverage consensus algorithms that come with an optimal consensus threshold. This threshold value dictates the number of validator nodes required to operate the Utility. To meet the needs of a decentralized ledger, each validator node must be operated by an independent and unique participant. Therefore, a quantity requirement associated with one or more classes of members will be tied to the number of required validator nodes. Validator nodes may also be referred to as utility infrastructure nodes or Stewards from a historical Sovrin Foundation context. See Glossary for more details. A balance between budget requirements and technology limitations will define the number of validator nodes required to operate the Utility. Initially this will be set at twenty-five (25) utility infrastructure nodes. The set of active nodes on the network will be periodically pulled from a pool of available nodes. Validator Node Pool \u00b6 In order to efficiently operate the ledger associated with the Utility, a combination of production, test, and development environments are necessary. The Governing Board is responsible for defining the requirements associated with the validator pool. It is important to note that such Governing Board decisions will be influenced by both technical performance restrictions as well as budgetary demands. Framework Facet Required Quantity Comment Governing Board Seats 7 Minimum Governing Members. Governing Board seats can increase but MUST not exceed 15 Minimum Production Pool Size 19 Considers production and Governing Board factors. Minimum Test Pool Size 3 Ledger used by Utility Service Provider and Wallet Project contributors. Minimum Development Pool Size 3 Ledger used by Utility Service Provider and Wallet Project contributors. Minimum Total Pool Size 25 Considers requirements across all environments. Steward Population Dynamics \u00b6 The number of Board of Director seats SHOULD be consistent as the population of Stewards (Governing and Operational Members) increases. Board of Director Seats Required Stewards BoD% 7 25 0.28 9 36 0.25 11 44 0.25 13 52 0.25 15 60 0.25 The Governing Board maintains a FIFO Waiting List of Operational Members that have maintained consistent membership. Position on the waiting list is based upon date of membership of the Operational Member. This list shall be used to offer new Governing Board seats upon availability due to attrition or growth. Membership Types \u00b6 Building on our Glossary , participants in the Consortium are referred to as Trust Community Members . These business entities agreed to participate in the Trust Community known as the Canadian Credential Network. Participation in the Consortium is possible via formal legal contracts or membership agreements. Annual Membership \u00b6 Membership details herein provide a synopsis of the information outlined in \"Exhibit B\" and \"Exhibit C\" of the Canadian Credential Network Charter within the Canadian Credential Network Participation Agreement (the \"Participation Agreement\"). Private sector entities (businesses) can join and renew membership on an annual basis under three possible membership types: Membership Type Validator Node Hosting Required Required Governing Body Participation Authorized Endorser Privileges (Ledger Writes) Governing Member Yes - 1 Yes - 1 Person Per Governing Body Yes - Unlimited Operational Member Yes - 1 Yes - 2 Persons Yes - Unlimited Subscriber No No Yes - Limited Governing Member: Description : Members that are willing to contribute to the infrastructure, management, and financial needs of the Utility. Obligations : MUST host one or more utility infrastructure Validator Nodes as defined in Exhibit C of the Participation Agreement. MUST sign the required Utility Agreements as set forth in Exhibit B of the Participation Agreement. MUST assign appropriately skilled resources, as detailed in Exhibit B of the Participation Agreement, that will meet the required commitments for the Governing Board, the Committees, additional committees or working groups established by the Directed Fund in the future, and the Wallet Project. Entitlements : MAY appoint a representative on the Governing Board, provided, however, that a Utility Service Provider may not appoint a representative to the Governing Board. MAY appoint a representative to any Committee, provided that a Utility Service Provider may not appoint a representative to the Finance Committee. MAY act, pending signed Utility Agreements, as a Transaction Endorser. MAY write Transactions as a Transaction Endorser as defined in Exhibit C of the Participation Agreement. Restrictions : Membership is limited to the number of Board of Director seats available. A FIFO waiting list is maintained by Governing Board to allow for new members to fill voids left by exiting members. Utility Service Providers MAY NOT be a Governing Member. Utility Service Providers MAY NOT participate in the Finance Committee.

In order to establish an operational budget for the Utility, several infrastructure assumptions must be considered. Budgetary requirements dictate how much revenue is required to keep the Utility sustainable. Distributed ledger technologies, like Indy, leverage consensus algorithms that come with an optimal consensus threshold. This threshold value dictates the number of validator nodes required to operate the Utility. To meet the needs of a decentralized ledger, each validator node must be operated by an independent and unique participant. Therefore, a quantity requirement associated with one or more classes of members will be tied to the number of required validator nodes. Validator nodes may also be referred to as utility infrastructure nodes or Stewards from a historical Sovrin Foundation context. See Glossary for more details. A balance between budget requirements and technology limitations will define the number of validator nodes required to operate the Utility. Initially this will be set at twenty-five (25) utility infrastructure nodes. The set of active nodes on the network will be periodically pulled from a pool of available nodes.","title":"Utility Infrastructure Requirements"},{"location":"gf_info/membership/#validator-node-pool","text":"In order to efficiently operate the ledger associated with the Utility, a combination of production, test, and development environments are necessary.

The nodes of this immutable Utility are hosted by a variety of business entities around the world, called Stewards. The Utility is intended to enable Transaction Authors (see below) to publish decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and other cryptographic data structures required for the issuance and verification of digital credentials. The Utility is legally represented as three (3) distinct but related legal entities which are associated with a collection of contractual instruments. The Canadian Credential Network Utility Fund (the \u201cDirected Fund\u201d), is a directed fund project of The Linux Foundation (the \"LF\"). The Directed Fund serves two purposes: Manage the operation and maintenance of the Canadian Credential Network Utility (\u201cthe Utility\u201d), a LF Operational Project (a Delaware series limited liability company) Support for the Canacred Wallet Project, (the \u201cWallet Project\u201d), an open source project, a LF Network Project. It is expected that the Utility will be used primarily by businesses who have a need to exchange trusted data such as digital credentials. The credentials themselves are never written to the Utility so issuers of these credentials ( Transaction Authors ) have no need to write data to the Utility. This approach avoids issuers increasing risks associated with personal data under data protection regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Data Protection \u00b6 The Sovrin Foundation in conjunction with its legal counsel Perkins Coie published a white paper providing a detailed legal analysis of the applicability of the GDPR to the Sovrin Utility and Sovrin Network. The GDPR Position Paper assesses data protection requirements at Layers 1-3 of the ToIP Stack. The Canadian Credential Network recognizes this work-product as prior art given its applicability to any public identity utility. This paper is a foundational legal document for the importance of permissioned-write access to the ledger. See Issue 16 pertaining to the storage location of this paper after the transition effort of the Sovrin Foundation. Legal Architecture \u00b6 The following figure is a visual illustration of the key roles and agreements in the Canadian Credential Network\u2019s legal framework for regulatory compliance with data protection laws. Although it uses terms from the GDPR, it is intended for compliance with general data protection regulations. The following sections explain the actors, roles, policies, and legal agreements depicted in this diagram. Note that formal definitions for all terms that appear in First Letter Capitals are provided in the Glossary . Actors & Roles \u00b6 Canadian Credential Network \u00b6 The Canadian Credential Network is an international non-profit public trust organization chartered to provide governance for the Canadian Credential Network Utility. Represented by the Governing Board of the Utility, the Consortium represents the Designated Data Controller . In this role, the Consortium is a broker between Transaction Authors, the Primary Data Controller , and other Utility actors. Network Members \u00b6 In order to participate in the Consortium as either a Steward, a Transaction Endorser or both; the desired participant MUST sign the Participation Agreement. This agreement allocates write access entitlements by membership level. Transaction Authors \u00b6 A Transaction Author is any Organization who submits a Transaction to be written to the Utility. This role in the BBU-GF is available to both members and non-members. As explained below, under the Permissioned Write Access policies of the BBU-GF, only Organizations may write Transactions. Transaction Authors may write any data type supported by the Utility \u2014 see What Goes On The Ledger? Transaction Endorsers \u00b6 A Transaction Endorser is an Organization that has been approved by the Canadian Credential Network to endorse Transactions on behalf of Transaction Authors. The role of Transaction Endorser is specified by the Permissioned Write Access policies of the BBU-GF. Transaction Endorsers add their digital signature to a Transaction so it will be accepted and written by the Stewards. Transaction Endorsers MUST enter into both the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement with the Canadian Credential Network. Subscribers \u00b6 We'll replace it Stewards \u00b6 Stewards are trusted institutions who operate a Node of the Utility. Stewards MUST meet the qualifications specified in Member Business Policies and Member Technical and Organizational Policies . Stewards must enter into both the Steward Agreement and the Steward Data Processing Agreement with the Canadian Credential Network. Stewards are automatically qualified to be Transaction Endorsers but they MUST sign the appropriate Transaction Endorser contracts with the Canadian Credential Network. Utility Access Policies \u00b6 Permissioned Write Access \u00b6 This is the set of policies that require Transaction Authors to obtain the endorsement of a Transaction Endorser in order to write a Transaction to the Utility. There are two primary reasons for the Permissioned Write Access policy: It protects the Utility by requiring Transaction Endorsers, who have a direct contractual relationship with the Canadian Credential Network to enforce the Permissioned Write Access policies, to ensure that a Transaction Author Agreement is in effect and to leverage an allocated write unit as a form of payment for a Transaction. Write Units are acquired based on Membership Type. It reduces the risk of Personal Data being written to the Utility as that is currently prohibited under the Permissioned Write Access policies. The Canadian Credential Network feels this protection is necessary under the current regulatory uncertainty regarding Personal Data on an immutable public ledger. See the Data Protection section of this document for more details. Public Write Access \u00b6 Under Public Write Access policies, the requirement of a Transaction Endorser signing a Transaction Authors request is eliminated; anyone would be able to write to the Utility by following a programmatic process that aims to provide the necessary assurances against privacy compliance risks. This form of access to the Utility is prohibited under the BBU-GF . Legal Document Architecture \u00b6 Primary Legal Agreements \u00b6 Participation Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Canadian Credential Network and all members. It has been developed by the Linux Foundation in support of Directed Fund projects. This agreement is the binding agreement for all members. Transaction Author Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Canadian Credential Network and all Transaction Authors. It has been developed specifically to protect the right of every Transaction Author to have and hold self-sovereign identity credentials while also protecting the Utility and the infrastructure provided by the Canadian Credential Network as a global public utility. It is intended to give effect to the data protection rights of all Transaction Authors while recognizing the technical and security requirements of a public-permissioned immutable Utility. As part of the Transaction Author Agreement, every Transaction Author also agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to the Transaction Author as a controller under the Steward Data Processing Agreement and the Transaction and the Transaction Endorser Agreement to include a Data Processing Agreement. The Utility itself is the authoritative record of all Transaction Author Agreement signatures. Transaction Endorser Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Canadian Credential Network and all Transaction Endorsers. This agreement is simpler in scope than the Transaction Author Agreement. It is limited to enforcing Permissioned Write Access policies and verifying that Transaction Authors have executed the Transaction Author Agreement. The Transaction Endorser Agreement requires that the Transaction Endorser separately execute the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement and includes a current version of the Transaction Author Agreement as an Appendix. This agreement does not address the exchange of payment (value) between the Transaction Endorser and the Transaction Author. Such usage fees associated with the allocation of write transaction entitlements is out-of-scope for the BBU-GF. Steward Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Canadian Credential Network and all Stewards. It covers all the rights and obligations of the Canadian Credential Network and Stewards under the Bedrock Governance Framework. The Steward Agreement requires that the Steward separately execute the Steward Data Processing Agreement. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) \u00b6 Transaction Endorser DPA \u00b6 This is the DPA required of all Transaction Endorsers acting as Data Processors for the Transaction Author as primary Data Controller and the Canadian Credential Network acting as the Designated Data Controller. It requires that the Transaction Endorser implement its own set of Technical and Operational Measures (TOMs) that MUST meet or exceed the Transaction Endorser Technical and Organizational Policies (TOPs) specified in the Bedrock Governance Framework. Steward DPA \u00b6 This is the DPA required of Stewards. It requires that the Steward implement its own TOMs that meets or exceeds the Steward TOPs. Technical and Organizational Policies (TOPs) \u00b6 Transaction Endorser TOPs \u00b6 This is the set of policies in the Bedrock Governance Framework that establish the minimum technical and organization policies and procedures that a Transaction Endorser MUST implement in its own Technical and Operational Measures (TOMs) to provide adequate security, privacy, and data protection for Transaction Authors and the Canadian Credential Network. Steward TOPs \u00b6 Similar to the Transaction Endorser TOPs, this is the set of policies in the Bedrock Governance Framework that establish the minimum technical and organization policies and procedures that a Steward must implement in its own Technical and Operational Measures (TOMs) to provide adequate security, privacy, and data protection for Transaction Authors and the Canadian Credential Network.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"gf_legal/legal_arch/#introduction","text":"The Canadian Credential Network Utility (the \"Utility\") is governed by the Canadian Credential Network as a dedicated public-permissioned blockchain ledger. The nodes of this immutable Utility are hosted by a variety of business entities around the world, called Stewards. The Utility is intended to enable Transaction Authors (see below) to publish decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and other cryptographic data structures required for the issuance and verification of digital credentials. The Utility is legally represented as three (3) distinct but related legal entities which are associated with a collection of contractual instruments. The Canadian Credential Network Utility Fund (the \u201cDirected Fund\u201d), is a directed fund project of The Linux Foundation (the \"LF\"). The Directed Fund serves two purposes: Manage the operation and maintenance of the Canadian Credential Network Utility (\u201cthe Utility\u201d), a LF Operational Project (a Delaware series limited liability company) Support for the Canacred Wallet Project, (the \u201cWallet Project\u201d), an open source project, a LF Network Project. It is expected that the Utility will be used primarily by businesses who have a need to exchange trusted data such as digital credentials. The credentials themselves are never written to the Utility so issuers of these credentials ( Transaction Authors ) have no need to write data to the Utility. This approach avoids issuers increasing risks associated with personal data under data protection regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"gf_legal/legal_arch/#data-protection","text":"The Sovrin Foundation in conjunction with its legal counsel Perkins Coie published a white paper providing a detailed legal analysis of the applicability of the GDPR to the Sovrin Utility and Sovrin Network.
