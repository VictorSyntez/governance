<h2 id="_Toc435533035">PART 1</a> &ndash; GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>

<h3 id="_Toc435533036">1.1 Introduction</h3>


<p>  The
purpose of this handbook is to provide general information on the nature of a
not-for-profit corporation and guidelines on how to incorporate such a
corporation. This handbook also provides basic information on incorporating
charitable corporations, which are a special type of not-for-profit
corporation. </p>

<p>Not-for-profit corporations incorporated in Ontario are governed by the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong>
and the Regulations made under it. Incorporation of not-for-profit
corporations under the Act is at the discretion of the Minister (or his
delegate). This is in contrast to &lsquo;incorporation as of right&rsquo; for business
corporations incorporating under the <strong><em>Business Corporations Act</em></strong>.
Certain pertinent sections to the Act and the Regulations are included in this
handbook. The reader is, however, referred to the <strong><em>Corporations Act </em></strong>and
the Regulations to examine those sections not set out here. </p>

 
<p>This handbook contains
general statements concerning the requirements of the Act and Regulations which
are intended to serve only as a general guide and not as a substitute for
statute when dealing with specific problems. Also, reference to this handbook
should not be a substitute for consultation with a lawyer on legal considerations
or an accountant on financial matters.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533037">1.2 Nature of a Corporation</h3>

 

<p> In law, a corporation is an artificial
person or a legal entity having an independent existence, separate and distinct
from that of its members. The corporation owns property in its own name,
acquires rights, obligations and liabilities, enters into contracts and
agreements and has the capacity to sue and be sued as would a natural person.</p>

 

<p>Thus,
for example, a corporation may be insolvent while its individual members may be
wealthy. As a separate legal entity a corporation is not affected by changes
in its membership and its existence continues in perpetuity unless its members
or the government take steps to dissolve it.</p>

 

<p>A
corporation is managed or governed by a board of directors, which is elected by
the members. The board of directors, in turn, elects a president and appoints
other officers such as a secretary, treasurer etc. who are responsible for the
actual operation of the corporation.</p>

 

<p>The
directors, officers and members do not &ldquo;own&rdquo; the corporation, nor do they have
any right of ownership to any particular asset of the corporation and the
corporation may not be operated for pecuniary gain of its members, directors or
officers.</p>

 

<p>In
certain circumstances, a not-for-profit corporation may engage in activities
that are revenue producing and that produce a surplus, or &ldquo;profit&rdquo;. However,
such activities must be incidental to the principal objects of the corporation
and in furtherance of the principal objects. For example, a hockey club may
hold a dance to raise funds for new uniforms for the team. If, after paying
the expenses, the dance produces a &ldquo;profit&rdquo;, the monies belong to the club and
must be used for the benefit of the club (i.e. to purchase new uniforms for its
team).</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533038">1.3 Should you Incorporate?</h3>

 

<p> The
act of incorporation offers certain advantages to the incorporators and their
successors but at the same time it also places certain responsibilities upon
them. Accordingly, before proceeding with incorporation, the members of an
unincorporated organization should give the matter serious consideration. In
this regard you may wish to consult a lawyer who has experience in corporate
matters and who, given all the facts, can advise you whether it would be to
your advantage to incorporate.</p>

 

<p>If you need a lawyer, you may wish to make an on-line request for a referral from the <a href="https://lso.ca/public-resources/finding-a-lawyer-or-paralegal/law-society-referral-service?lang=en-ca">Law Society Referral Service</A>. The Law Society Referral Service provides the name of a lawyer or a paralegal within or near your community who will provide a full consultation of up to 30 minutes to help you determine your rights and options, provided a match is available (see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

 

<p>It is not mandatory for a not-for-profit
organization to incorporate. There are in existence hundreds, possibly even
thousands, of unincorporated organizations in Ontario that are carrying on
their activities without any hindrance. Unincorporated organizations do not
have a separate legal existence apart from their members.</p>

 

<h4>Advantages of Incorporation</h4>

 

<p>As
the corporation is a separate legal entity distinct from its members and has
the capacity to own property, to sue and be sued, it affords limited liability
protection to its members. This means that individual members are not
personally liable in certain instances, for the corporation&rsquo;s debts and
obligations.</p>

 

<p>The
corporation is not affected by changes in its members, be it due to death or
any other reason. Therefore, it is easier to enter into a number of
transactions in the name of the corporation such as, banking, owning real
estate or signing a lease or contract.</p>

 

<p>A
majority of the members of the corporation have the power to bind the others by
their acts.</p>

 

<h4>Disadvantages of Incorporation</h4>

 

<p>As
the corporation is a creature of statute, it is subject to some supervision by
the Government of Ontario and it must conduct its affairs in accordance with
the applicable statutes. For example, the constitution or by-laws of the
corporation, the election of directors and the calling of meetings of members
are all governed by the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong>. In addition, a
corporation is required to report certain information on a regular basis to
certain departments of the Government. </p>

 

<p>Failure
to comply with reporting or disclosure requirements could render the
corporation and its directors and officers liable to certain penalties,
including the cancellation of the corporation.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533039">1.4 Types of Corporations</h3>

 

<p> Not-for-profit
corporations are organizations that carry on activities without pecuniary
gain. They are incorporated under Part III of the<strong> <em>Corporations Act</em></strong>
as corporations without share capital. They are all subject to section 126,
which states:</p>

 

<blockquote>

<p>Not
to be carried on for gain -- section 126(1)</p>

 

<p>126. (1) A corporation, except a corporation to which Part V applies, <strong>shall be
carried on without the purpose of gain for its members and any profits or other
accretions to the corporation shall be used in promoting its objects and the
letters patent shall so provide</strong>, and, where a company is converted into a
corporation, the supplementary letters patent shall so provide.</p>
 

</blockquote>

<p>Applications
will not be accepted where the objects indicate that it is being incorporated
for the purpose of profit. </p>

 

<p>Below are
categories of the most common types of not-for-profit corporations:</p>

 

<ol type="A">

<li> General type - this would include such
corporations as ratepayers&rsquo; associations, professional associations, community
organizations, etc.;</li>

 

<li>  Sporting and athletic organizations;</li>

 

<li>  Social
clubs - these are corporations with objects in whole or in part of a social
nature;</li>

 

<li>Service clubs such as Rotary, Lions, Kiwanis and
Optimist;</li>



 

<li>  Charities - these would include religious
organizations and organizations that are engaged in carrying out certain good
works that are of benefit to society. (See Part 6 in this handbook)</li>

</ol>
 

<p>One
of the main differences between a charity and another type of not-for-profit
corporation is that upon dissolution a charity is required to distribute its
remaining assets to other charities, not to its members, whereas another type
of not-for-profit corporation may (unless prohibited from so doing in its
charter or by-laws) on dissolution distribute its remaining assets among its
members. Also, a charitable corporation, because it usually solicits funds
from the public and enjoys certain legal and tax advantages (e.g. under the
federal <strong><em>Income Tax Act</em></strong>), is subject to more stringent reporting
requirements than a not-for-profit corporation of another type.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533040">1.5 Incorporation Process and Corporate Maintenance</h3>

 

<p> If a decision is made to incorporate,
you should take the following steps:</p>

 
<ol>


<li>  Determine if objects of
the organization will be those of a charity. If so, see Part 6 of this
handbook.</li>

 

<li>Select the proposed corporate
name (see Part 2 of this handbook).</li>

 

<li>Prepare and file the
application for incorporation (see Part 3 of this handbook).</li>

 

<li>Following the receipt of the
Letters Patent of incorporation, organize the corporation (see Part 4 of this
handbook).</li>

 

<li> The organization of a
corporation is followed by an ongoing activity of &ldquo;corporate maintenance&rdquo;, that
is, ensuring that the corporation complies with the reporting requirements and
conducts its affairs in accordance with the applicable Acts and Regulations
(see Part 5 of this handbook).</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="_Toc435533041">1.6 Self-help Remedies Available under the <em>Corporations Act</em></h3>

<p> The <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong>
does not provide the Ministry with the authority to intervene and resolve
internal disputes between members and its Board of Directors. It does provide
members with various self-help remedies to ensure compliance with the Act.</p>

<p>You may wish to consult private legal counsel in determining the appropriate remedies available to you. See Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo; for information about the  Law Society Referral Service.</p>

<h2 id="_Toc435533042">PART 2 &ndash; CORPORATE NAME</h2>

<h3 id="_Toc435533043">2.1 Name not to be Deceptively Similar</h3>

<p> The Act (section 13(1)(a)) provides that a corporation shall not be given a name
that is the same as or similar to the name of a known corporation, association,
partnership, individual or business if the use of the proposed name would be
likely to deceive, except where the existing corporation, association, etc.
gives a consent in writing. The existing entity may also be required to
dissolve or change its name. In other words, the Act permits the granting of a
similar corporate name so long as the proposed name is not CONFUSINGLY or
DECEPTIVELY SIMILAR to an existing name. No identical names are permitted,
regardless of whether consent is given or the existing entity changes its name
or dissolves. </p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533044">2.2 Name to be Distinctive</h3>

<p> Basically, to comply with the provisions of the Act, new corporate names must be &ldquo;distinctive&rdquo; - and this
distinctiveness must survive certain media distortion as the corporation
identifies itself to the various sectors of the public with which it interacts
- including other corporations, its members, creditors, the general public and
government agencies. In other words, a new corporate name must be such that it
will not be confused with EXISTING names of corporations, trademarks or
unincorporated organizations and will not MISLEAD or CONFUSE the public as to
the undertaking or nature of the corporation or its relationship to other

<h3 id="_Toc435533045">2.3 Types of Distinctiveness</h3>

 

<p> The name itself may be distinctive or
may acquire its distinctiveness through long use.</p>

 

<p>Usually the most distinctive or
unique names have a coined word as the distinctive element, for example:</p>

 

<ul>

	<li> Avinta Social Club</li>

	<li> Zaltak Hockey Association</li>

	<li> 5-P Bowling Club</li>
	

</ul>
 

<p>Unusual
use or combination of generic words may produce a distinctive name, for
example:</p>

 

<ul>

	<li> All-That-Jazz Club</li>

	<li> Sorcerers Hockey Club</li>

	<li> Magic Eleven Soccer Club</li>
	

</ul>
 

<p>Words
that are coined using parts of other words, geographical location, numbers,
initials and dictionary words make a less distinctive name, for example: </p>

 

<ul>

	<li> Sundance Social Club</li>

	<li> Kenora Hockey Association</li>

	<li> Guelph Dance Club</li>

	<li> Northern Lights Skating
	Club</li>
	

</ul>
 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533046">2.4 Elements of A Corporate Name</h3>

 

<p> Most corporate names consist of three
elements:</p>

 

<ol>

<li>The <strong>DISTINCTIVE</strong>
element is the main identifier of the corporate name. It may be a coined word
or a dictionary word used in a fanciful sense quite different from its ordinary
meaning or a geographic term. Every corporate name must have a distinctive
element.</li>


<li>The <strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong>
element describes the nature of the main corporate undertaking. Care should be
taken not to use terms that may be deceiving or misleading.</li>

<li>  
The <strong>LEGAL</strong>
element indicates the status of the organization as an incorporated body.
Either &ldquo;Corporation&rdquo; or &ldquo;Incorporated&rdquo; or &ldquo;Incorpor&eacute;e&rdquo; or their abbreviations
may be used. The use of a legal element is optional. </li>

</ol>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> A corporation without share capital
cannot have &ldquo;Limited&rdquo;, &ldquo;Limit&eacute;e&rdquo; or the corresponding abbreviations as part of
the name.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533047">2.5 Name not to be too general</h3>

 

<p> Regulation
181(section 5) provides that a corporate name shall not be too general. The
reason for this prohibition is that corporate names that are too general tend
to infringe on a number of existing names, are likely to contribute to
confusion and unduly restrict or limit the possibility of using names in the
future that otherwise would be available to the public except for the existence
of the name that is too general.</p>

 

<p>A corporate name that is too
general may be defined as a name that usually lacks the distinctive or
descriptive element (see Item 2.4 Elements of a Corporate Name).</p>


<p><strong>Example
A:</strong> names that are
too general consist of only the descriptive and the legal elements, or only the
distinctive and legal elements:</p>


<ul>

<li>                     
Student Exchange
Corporation (lacks the distinctive element)</li>

<li>                     
Canvelo Inc.
(lacks the descriptive element)</li>

<li>                     
Jazz Singers
Friendship Society (lacks the distinctive element)</li>


</ul>
 

<p><strong>Example
B:</strong> a general name
can be rectified by adding the missing distinctive or descriptive element:</p>

 

<ul>

<li> Don
Mills Student Exchange Corporation (distinctive element added)</li>

<li> Canvelo
Cycling Club Inc. (descriptive element added)</li>

<li> Soundville
Jazz Singers Friendship Society (distinctive element added)</li>

</ul>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533048">2.6 Name not to Suggest Connection with the Crown</h3>

 

<p> The
Act (clause 13(1)(b)) provides that a corporation shall not be given a name
that suggests or implies connection with the Crown or the Royal Family.</p>

 

<p>The consent of the Governor General
(see Contacts &ndash; Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;), on advice from the federal Department of
Canadian Heritage, has to be obtained by the applicant where the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo;
is used as a prefix in a corporate name and where it suggests Royal Patronage.
The onus is on the applicant to obtain such consent. </p>

 

<p><strong>Example A:</strong> corporation
names that <strong>suggest</strong> Royal Patronage and <strong>need the consent</strong> of the
Governor General:</p>

<ul>


<li> The Royal Agricultural
Winter Fair</li>

<li> The Royal Canadian Yacht
Club</li>

<li> The Prince Charles Youth
Foundation</li>

</ul>

 

<p><strong>Example
B:</strong> corporation names
where &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; is used as a descriptive adjective in the use of &ldquo;majestic&rdquo; or
&ldquo;grand&rdquo; and Royal Patronage is <strong>not</strong> suggested and therefore the consent
of the Governor General, is <strong>not required</strong>:</p>

<ul>


<li> Royal Wave Surfing
Association</li>

<li> Royal Mountain Ski Club</li>

</ul>


<h3 id="_Toc435533049">2.7 Name not to Suggest Connection with Government</h3>


<p>The Act (section 13(1)(b)) provides that a corporation shall not be given a name that suggests or implies connection with any government or a government department, agency or activity without the written consent of the appropriate authority.  In this connection particular attention should be given to the use of the words &ldquo;Canada&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ontario&rdquo;.  Federal Government departments are using names such as &ldquo;Canada Revenue Agency&rdquo;,  &ldquo;Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada&rdquo; and care should be taken with proposed corporate names using this style.</p>

<p><strong>Example A:</strong> names that <strong>suggest</strong> or <strong>imply</strong> government connection:</p>

<ul>

<li> Heritage Ontario</li>

<li> Multi-Culture Canada</li>

<li> Metro Toronto Sports and
Recreation Authority</li>



</ul> 

<p><strong>Example
B:</strong> names implying
government connection may be modified by rearranging and adding words thus
eliminating the suggested government connection:</p>

 

<ul>

<li> Heritage Association of Kingston, Ontario</li>

<li> Canadian Multi-Cultural
Society of Timmins</li>

<li> Sports and Recreation
Association of Metro Toronto</li>


</ul>
 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533050">2.8 Use of the Name of Another Province</h3>

 

<p> Certain other provinces restrict the
use of the name of their province in a corporate name. Accordingly, where it
is desired to use the name of another province in a proposed corporate name,
the incorporators should first contact the Director, Corporations Branch or
Registrar of Companies, as the case may be, of the province in question to
ensure the name will be acceptable. A name is not permitted that suggests or
implies a connection with the Crown or government or any department, branch,
bureau, service, agency or activity of any government without the consent in
writing of the appropriate authority. </p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533051">2.9 Languages Permitted in the Corporate Name</h3>

 

<p> In
Ontario the name for a not-for-profit corporation may be in any language,
provided that only letters from the Roman alphabet or Arabic numerals or a
combination thereof, together with such punctuation marks and other marks as
are permitted by Regulation (O.Reg. 181 - section 8) are used, and the name
complies with the requirements set out in the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong>
and its Regulations. The English language is an example of a language which
uses letters from the Roman alphabet.</p>

 

<p>Despite
the above, the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong> (section 22) provides that a
not-for-profit corporation may have a special provision in its Letters Patent
or Supplementary Letters Patent allowing for the use of the approved corporate
name in any form and any language. In other words, an exact translation of the
corporate name into another language may be used. This is permitted, provided
that such form and such language are clearly set out in the special provision.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533052">2.10 Prohibited Words / Expressions</h3>


<p> The
Regulation (O. Reg. 181) prohibits the use of some words and expressions and
restricts the use of others. Here is a summary of such prohibitions and
restrictions:</p>


<h4>Subsection 3 (1)</h4>

<p>The following words and expressions
shall not be used in a corporate name:</p>


<ul>

<li>
&ldquo;Amalgamated&rdquo;,
unless the corporation is an amalgamated corporation resulting from the
amalgamation of two or more corporations.</li>

<li>&ldquo;College&rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;institute&rdquo; or &ldquo;university&rdquo; except with a consent in writing on behalf of the <strong>Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development</strong> (see Contacts &ndash; Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;) </li>

<li>
&ldquo;Engineer&rdquo; or
&ldquo;engineering&rdquo; or any variation thereof, except with the consent in writing of
the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario (see Contacts &ndash; Appendix
&ldquo;G&rdquo;). </li>

<li>
&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; where used
as an adjective, unless the consent of the Crown has been obtained through the
Governor General (see part 2.6 for details).</li>

<li>
Numerals
indicating the year of incorporation, unless the proposed corporation is the
successor to a corporation the name of which is the same as or similar to the
proposed corporation, or the year is the year of amalgamation of the
corporation.</li>

<li>
Any word or
expression that would lead to an inference that the corporation is a business
corporation.</li>

</ul>



<h4>Subsection 5 (b) and (c)</h4>


<p>With
limited exceptions noted in this section, a corporate name cannot be:</p>

<p>-                                 
primarily or only
a given name or surname used alone of an individual who is living or has died
within the previous thirty years</p>

<p>-                                 
primarily or only
a geographic name used alone.</p>


<h4>Subsection 6(1)</h4>

<p>A
corporate name shall not contain a word or expression, an element of which is
the family name of a particular individual who is living or who has died within
the previous thirty years, whether or not preceded by a given name or initials,
unless the individual, his heir, executor, administrator, assigns or guardian
consents in writing to the use of his name. Certain limited exceptions are set
out in subsections 6(2) and (3).</p>

 

<h4>Section 7</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>A
corporate name shall not contain any word or expression in any language that
describes in a misleading manner the activities or services in association with
which the corporate name is proposed to be used. </p>


<div class=WordSection5>

 

<h4>Section 9</h4>


<p>A corporate name shall not exceed 120 characters in length,
including punctuation marks and spaces.</p>

 

<p>The
<strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong> and its Regulations are available on the
ServiceOntario e-laws Web Site at <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/">www.e-laws.gov.on.ca</a>. </p>

 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533053">2.11 Choosing the Corporate Name</h3>


<p> When
choosing the corporate name, consider the many and varied situations in which
the corporate name will be used. For example, the name may be used visually
(on stationery, signs, uniforms, cheques, correspondence, newsprint,
advertising, etc.) and auditorially (telephone, radio, television). In each of
these uses it would be to the advantage of the corporation to have a name that
is memorable. To this end, the name should be distinctive and short.</p>

<p>Usually,
a coined word or a dictionary word used in a fanciful sense quite different
from its ordinary meaning can make a corporate name that is both distinctive
and memorable. For example, &ldquo;Canvelo Cycle Club&rdquo; (for a cycling club) and
&ldquo;Magic Eleven Soccer Club&rdquo; are likely to be memorable names that are easy to
use visually and auditorially. As a rule of thumb, avoid using long,
cumbersome names such as &ldquo;Chirpsqueak Society of Friends of Non-Migratory Song
Birds of South-Western Ontario&rdquo;.</p>


<p>Using
your imagination in coining the distinctive element and carefully searching the
proposed corporate name will, in the long run, save you time and money.
Accordingly, when your group decides to incorporate, the following steps are
recommended for choosing a corporate name:</p>

 

<ol>

<li>Get your group together for
a &ldquo;brainstorming&rdquo; session to come up with a word or words that would make the
proposed name unique. A coined word usually is very effective. Try to have a
least three choices.</li>

<li>Check section 13 of the <strong><em>Corporations
Act</em></strong> and its Regulations to ensure that the proposed name does not
conflict with the Act or the Regulations. The Regulations prohibit the use of
certain words and restrict the use of others. <a name="OLE_LINK2">The Act and
the Regulations are available on the ServiceOntario e-laws Web site </a>at <a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/">www.e-laws.gov.on.ca</a> and
should be available in the reference department of your local public library or
they may be purchased through the ServiceOntario Publications website at <a
href="http://www.publications.serviceontario.ca/ecom">www.publications.serviceontario.ca/ecom</a>.
</li>

<li>After the
initial choice has been made, check the proposed name against the names listed
in the telephone directories, municipal directories, hobby or sports magazines,
etc. Many of these publications should be available in your local public
library or on the Internet. If your proposed name is confusingly similar to
the name of an existing organization or corporation then abandon it and go to
your second choice, third choice and so on, and if necessary, back to some more
&ldquo;brainstorming&rdquo;.</li>

<li>          
If the proposed
corporate name will require consent from an individual or an existing
organization, the applicants should obtain written consent before ordering a
name search. For example, where the proposed corporation is to
be affiliated with an existing corporation with a similar name the applicants
should contact the existing corporation to ensure the organization will
provide written consent. See part 2.10 for examples of when consent is
required.</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="_Toc435533054">2.12 Checklist</h3>

<p> You
may save time and expense by checking the proposed name against this
check-list. Remember, Search Houses charge a fee for each search of a proposed
name. Accordingly, before requesting the required original Ontario-biased
Nuans name search report, use this check-list to satisfy yourself that the name
you have chosen does not conflict with the Act and Regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Is the proposed name:</strong></p>

<ol>

	<li>PROHIBITED BY THE ACT OR REGULATIONS?<br>
		Section 13 of the Act and sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and/or 9 of Regulation 181.</li>

	 
	<li>DISTINCTIVE?

	<ol type="a">

		<li>Too general?<br>
			Section 5 of the Regulations </br>
			items 2.4, 2.5 of this handbook</li>


		<li>Only descriptive?<br>
			Item 2.4 of this handbook</li>

		<li>Primarily only name or surname?<br>
			Sections 5 and 6 of the Regulations</li>

		<li>Primarily or only geographic name>?<br>
			Section 5 of the Regulations</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	 
	<li>MISLEADING?<br>
		Section 7 of the Regulations</li>

	<li>DECEPTIVE / CONFUSING?<br>
		Section 13 of the Act</li>

</ol>
 

<p>Check
local telephone directories and the Internet for identical or deceptively
similar names. Consider degree of similarity of: </p>

<ul>

	<li>appearance</li>
	<li>sound</li>
	<li>meaning</li>        

</ul>
 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533055">2.13 The Corporate Name Search Report</h3>

 

<p>  If the proposed name does not appear
to be deceptively/confusingly similar to the name of an existing organization
or corporation, and does not appear otherwise to contravene the Act or the
Regulations, then you should contact a Search House in order to obtain an
original Ontario-biased Nuans name search report for the proposed name of the
corporation (see Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;, Search Houses). </p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533056">2.14 Warning - use of the Proposed Name</h3>

 

<p> <strong>Do not</strong> complete the application for
incorporation until you receive the name search report. The completed
application must be submitted with the original Ontario-biased name search
report. The name search report cannot
be dated more than 90 days prior to the submission of the application. For
example, applications submitted on November 28<sup>th</sup> could be
accompanied by an original Ontario-biased name search report dated as early as
August 30<sup>th</sup>, but not dated earlier. <strong>Do not</strong> print any stationery, or order a corporate
seal or enter into any transactions using the corporate name until the Letters
Patent incorporating the corporation are issued.</p>

 

<h2 id="_Toc435533057">PART 3 &ndash; INCORPORATION</h2>


 
<h3 id="_Toc435533058">3.1 Pre-incorporation Considerations</h3>

 

<p> At
this point, you should consider whether the activities or undertaking of the
proposed corporation may come under the supervision or regulation of, or be of
interest to a Ministry or an Agency of the Government. In particular:</p>

 

<ul>

	<li> Will the corporation seek
	financial assistance from the Government?</li>

	<li>  Are the proposed
	activities of the corporation regulated by a Ministry or Agency of the
	Government?</li>

	<li>  Will the
	corporation engage in activities that would supplement services provided by a
	Ministry or Agency of the Government?</li>

</ul>

 

<p>If
the answer to any one of the above questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then it may be wise to
consult the appropriate Ministry or Agency prior to completing the
application. Some Ministries or Agencies may require that you contact them
prior to incorporation and some may also offer suggestions for drafting objects
for the proposed corporation.</p>

 

<p>Such
consultation with the regulating bodies may, in the long run, save you time,
inconvenience and expense.</p>

 

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if the corporation is to operate a nursery school, home for children or a day care service, you should consult the Ministry of Children and Youth Services;</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to provide a home for the aged, you should consult both the Ministry of Community and Social Services, and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing;</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to provide cultural or citizenship programs you should consult the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration or the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport;</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to provide education or training programs you should consult the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development;</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to be a charity, you should consult the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (Ontario) and Canada Revenue Agency, Taxation; (see Part 6 of this handbook)</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to provide health care services or to engage in related activities or if the corporation is to be an association of health care professionals, you should consult the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care;</li>
	<li>if the corporation is to provide prisoner rehabilitation services you should consult the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not an exhaustive list of
instances where other Ministries are to be consulted.</p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533059">3.2 Completion of Application - General Comments</h3>

<p> The Application for Incorporation of a
Corporation without Share Capital, (Form 2 approved by the Minister as provided
for in the Regulations to the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong><em>)</em>, is
available on the ServiceOntario web site at www.ServiceOntario.ca or in person
from the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (see Contacts - Appendix
&ldquo;G&rdquo;). </p>

 

<p>Detailed
instructions for completion accompany each set of application forms and those instructions are not repeated in the
handbook. The information in this handbook is more general and is intended to
clarify and supplement the instructions that are supplied with the application
forms. </p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533060">3.3 Head Office</h3>

 

<p> Every
corporation is required to have a head office in Ontario (section 277 of the
Act). This does not necessarily mean that a corporation must own or lease a
special building or a suite of offices. The intention of the Act is to have an
address formally designated as the head office of the corporation where certain
records are kept and where the corporation may be reached by an interested
party. Some incorporators use their home address for this purpose and
accordingly that address is set out in Item 2 of the application for
incorporation.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533061">3.4 Directors</h3>
 
<p>The first directors, not fewer than three (section 283 of the Act) individuals named as directors in the Letters Patent, are the directors of the corporation until replaced by other individuals duly elected in their stead (section 284 of the Act). The first directors of the corporation have all the powers, duties and liabilities of directors that are elected to the board.</p>

<p>The office of director places on that person responsibilities and even liabilities. Accordingly, any person accepting a directorship should be prepared to assume the responsibilities that go with the director’s office. Directors and officers in exercising their powers and discharging their duties to the corporation have a duty to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation. They must exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances (section 127.1 of the Act).</p>

<p>Generally, no person is permitted to be a director of the corporation unless he or she is a member of the corporation, and if the person ceases to be a member, he or she automatically ceases to be a director (section 286).  However, a person may be a director of a corporation if he or she becomes a member of the corporation <strong>within ten days</strong> after his or her election or appointment as a director. If the person fails to become a member within the ten days, the person immediately ceases to be a director, and cannot be re-elected or reappointed unless he or she is a member of the corporation.</p> 

<p>Subsection 286(3) of the Act sets out exceptions. A not-for-profit corporation may provide in its by-laws that a person may be a director of the corporation even though the person is not a member of the corporation. A similar exception is set out for hospitals and stock exchanges.</p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533062">3.5 Objects - General</h3>

 

<h4> Definition of Objects</h4>

<p>Objects are concise statements of the ultimate
purpose of the corporation.</p>

<h4>Content of Objects - See Part 6 for charitable standard objects</h4>

<p>The principal objects, that is, objects which describe the primary undertaking of
the corporation, should be the first statement, followed by secondary objects,
if any.</p>

<p>The objects should not be an enumeration of the
proposed activities and/or the aims of the corporation. It is advisable to
keep the objects statement short but broad in nature, (except for charities,
see Part 6 of this handbook), since a general object will include the
particulars normally included in that sort of undertaking. On the other hand,
the objects should be sufficiently specific so as to avoid ambiguity. </p>

 

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: the objects for a community youth
organization might be drafted as follows:</p>

 
<ul>

<li>The
establishment and operation of a youth organization for the purpose of:

	<ol type="a">

		<li> promoting the best interests of teenagers in the
		Town of Kenora;</li>

		<li> promoting interest in athletics, sports and
	recreation and establishing and maintaining facilities and equipment for same.</li>

	</ol>
 
 and
other complementary purposes not inconsistent with these objectives.</li>


<li>The objects of a ratepayers&rsquo; association might be drafted as follows:

	<ol type="a">

		<li>The
		establishment and operation of a residents&rsquo; association for the purpose of</li>

		<li> promoting the interests of the residents of the
		community of Central Don Mills;</li>

		<li> carrying on research into problems connected
		with development of real property in the community.</li>

	</ol>
</li>
 

<li> The objects of a social
club, with premises, might be drafted as follows:

	<ol type="a">

		<li>The
		establishment and operation of a social club for the purpose of</li>

		<li> promoting social and recreational activities
		among the members of the corporation;</li>

		<li> providing recreational facilities and a club
		house for the accommodation of members of the corporation and their guests. </li>

	</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>SEE APPENDIX &ldquo;A&rdquo;</strong>
Draft Standard Clauses for non-profit, non-charitable, corporations under Part
III of the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong>.</p>

 

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Clause 4, on the Application for
Incorporation of a Corporation Without Share Capital under which the objects
are set out (i.e. &ldquo;The objects for which the corporation is incorporated are:&rdquo;)
must contain objects only and <strong>not</strong> powers or special provisions.</p>

 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533063">3.6 Objects - Charities</h3>

<p> See Part 6. of
this handbook. </p>

 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533064">3.7 Natural Person Powers</h3>

<p>All not-for-profit corporations have the capacity, and subject to the Act, the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person (section 126.1 of the Act). This ensures corporations have all the necessary powers to fulfill their objects.  Any powers to be restricted pursuant to subsection 126.1(4) should be specified in clause 5 of the application under Special Provisions. Not-for-profit corporations may also sell, lease, exchange or dispose of the undertaking of the corporation or any part of such undertaking, if authorized to do so by a special resolution (section 126.2 of the Act). </p>

 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533065">3.8 Pre-incorporation Contracts</h3>

<p>Within a reasonable time after it comes into existence, a corporation may adopt a contract made in its name or on its behalf before it came into existence.  Upon its adoption, the corporation is bound by the contract and is entitled to the benefits under the contract as if the corporation had been in existence at the date of the contract and had been a party to it; and a person who acted in the name of or on behalf of the corporation ceases to be bound by or entitled to the benefits under the contract (section 126.3 of the Act).</p>


<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533066">3.9 Special Provisions</h3>

<p>The applicants may ask to have embodied in the Letters Patent any provision that may be made the subject of a by-law of the corporation except for provisions concerning the term of office for the directors or providing for the election and retirement of directors in rotation.  The only provision that must appear in the Letters Patent of a corporation that is not a charity is the “No Gain” clause, which is pre-printed on the form.  In most cases it is sufficient to set out the special provisions in the by-laws rather than the Letters Patent as provisions included in the Letters Patent cannot be changed without filing Supplementary Letters Patent.</p>

<p>Some items that may be included in the special provisions section are:</p>

<!-- <p>(i) Borrowing powers (see wording in section 59)</p> -->

<ol type="i">
	<li>Distribution of assets</li>
	<li>Director&rsquo;s remuneration</li>
	<li>Membership qualification</li>
	<li>French or foreign version of name</li>
	<li>Other powers</li>
</ol>
 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533067">3.10 Objects and Special Provisions – Key Points</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;objects&rsquo; in the Letters Patent set out the purposes of the corporation, and the ‘special provisions’ deal with matters of corporate governance.  All such provisions must fall within the scope of the <cite>Corporations Act</cite>.  When an application for Letters Patent or Supplementary Letters Patent contains provisions that are not acceptable, the applicant is given an opportunity to revise the application.  The Act (sections 4, 5 and 9) provides authority for the Ministry to exercise discretion in reviewing applications and requiring revisions to proposed provisions.</p>


<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533068">3.11 Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances an application for incorporation must be accompanied by supporting documents. For example where the proposed name of the corporation is similar to a corporation, association, partnership or individual, a consent of that person would be required.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533069">3.12 Checklist</h3>

<ol type="a">

	<li>Have
	you fully completed <strong>all</strong> items in the application and, if not applicable,
	so stated?</li>

	<li>Have you enclosed with the application

	<ul>

	<li> an original Ontario-biased Nuans Name Search Report for the proposed name of the corporation?</li>

	<li>  a cheque for the
	appropriate amount made payable to the Minister of Finance?</li>

	<li>  the appropriate supporting
	documents, if required?</li>

	<li> a covering letter with the
	name, phone number and address of a contact person.</li>

	</ul>

	</li>
</ol>
 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533069-2">3.13 Timing</h3>

 

<p> An application
for incorporation is usually processed within approximately 6 to 8 weeks of
receipt in the Branch. The Letters Patent will bear the effective date as of
the date of delivery unless the application is returned for revision, in which
case Letters Patent will bear an effective date as of the date of redelivery to
ServiceOntario, provided the application is correct.</p>

 
<p>For
an additional payment (see Fees &ndash; Appendix &ldquo;F&rdquo;) there is an expedited service
available on request with a processing time of 7 business days. The expedited
service fee is for the review of application by the end of the seventh business
day following the day of the request.
When documents are deficient, they will be returned to the client for amendment
and the expedite service time no longer applies.</p>


<br>
<h2 id="_Toc435533070">PART 4 &ndash; ORGANIZATION AND START UP</h2>

<h3 id="_Toc435533071">4.1 Organization and Start Up</h3>

 

<p> Once the
corporation has received its Letters Patent, a number of essential steps are
required to be initiated so that the directors may properly administer the
affairs of the corporation. Among these steps are:</p>

<ul>

	<li> establishing directors&rsquo;
	quorum</li>

	<li> adoption of by-laws</li>

	<li> banking and financial
	arrangements</li>

	<li> appointment of auditors</li>

	<li> appointment of officers</li>

</ul>

<p>It
is advisable to retain the services of a lawyer who specializes in corporation
law to ensure the corporation is properly organized and the directors understand
their responsibilities. By having the corporation properly organized, you
should eliminate a number of potentially serious problems in the future.</p>

<p>You
should refer to the:</p>

<ol>

	<p> <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="_Toc435533072">PART 5 &ndash; CORPORATE MAINTENANCE AND FILING
REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<h3 id="_Toc435533073">5.1 Annual Meeting</h3>

<p> An annual
meeting of the members of the corporation must be held not later than eighteen
months after incorporation and subsequently not more than fifteen months after
the holding of the last annual meeting. (section 293)</p>



<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533074">5.2 Election of Directors and Officers</h3>

 

<p> Usually the
directors are elected annually at the general meeting by the members of the corporation.
Directors in office at the time are retired and, if eligible, may seek
re-election to resume office for another year. (subsection 287(1)(2))</p>

 

<p>Generally
directors are elected by members, and officers are appointed by the board of
directors. </p>

 

<p> There
are three exceptions:</p>

<ul>

	<li>directors
	by virtue of their office (ex-officio directors) (section 127)</li>

	<li>election
	of directors in rotation (subsection 287 (5))</li>

	<li>division
	of members into territorial or common interest groups (section 130)</li>

</ul>
 

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533075">5.3 Quorum for Meetings</h3>

<p> The quorum for
meetings of directors is a majority, unless otherwise provided for in the
Letters Patent, Supplementary Letters Patent or in a special resolution of the
corporation, and in any event shall not be less than two-fifths of the board of
directors. (section 288)</p>

 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533076">5.4 Reporting Requirements</h3>

<h4> Initial Return</h4>

<p><strong>Within
60 days</strong> after the
date of incorporation, the corporation is required to file an <strong>Initial Return</strong>
(see section 2 of the<strong> <em>Corporations Information Act</em></strong>) setting
out the prescribed corporate information (e.g. head office address, directors
and five most senior officers) with ServiceOntario.</p>

 

<h4>Notice of Change</h4>

<p>Subsequently,
if there is any change to the information filed with the Ministry, such as a
change in the Board of Directors or the corporation&rsquo;s head office address, the
corporation must file a Notice of Change (section 4 of the <strong><em>Corporations
Information Act</em></strong>) within 15 days after the change takes place.</p>

<p>Currently,
there is no fee for filing the Initial Return/Notice of Change, Form 1 with the
Central Production and Verification Services Branch. The appropriate form is
supplied to you at the time of incorporation. Additional forms may be obtained
in person from ServiceOntario and are also available on the ServiceOntario website at
www.ServiceOntario.ca. </p>

<p>The
Initial Notice/Notice of Change<strong> </strong>can be filed in person or by mail
to ServiceOntario or electronically through one of the Service Providers under
contract with the Ontario government. For information about the Service
Providers visit the ServiceOntario website at www.ServiceOntario.ca (see
Contacts, Service Providers - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

 

<h4>Corporations Information Act Annual Return Filings for Corporations</h4>


<p>Currently, the Canada Revenue Agency collects
the <em>Corporations Information Act </em>Annual Return on behalf of the Ministry
of Government and Consumer Services. Ontario corporations also have the option
of filing electronically through the Service Providers under contract with the Ontario government. (see Contacts, Service Providers - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;)</p>


 

<h4>The Corporations Information Act Annual Return (CIA AR) Process </h4>

 

<p>Regulation 182 under the Ontario <em>Corporations
Information Act</em> (CIA) has been amended to prescribe new requirements for
filing the CIA AR that are effective as of January 01, 2009, when these
amendments came into force together with related amendments to the CIA.</p>

 

<p>The following outlines the CIA AR filing
requirement changes and options for tax years ending <em>after</em> December 31,
2008, when the Canada Revenue Agency began collecting the CIA AR together with
tax or charity returns instead of the Ontario Ministry of Finance. Ontario corporations continue to have the option of filing a stand-alone CIA AR electronically through the Service Providers under contract with the Ontario government
for any current or previous tax year-end: </p>

 
<ul>
 <li>Non-profit corporations subject to the Ontario <em>     Corporations Act </em>that <em>ARE</em>
     Registered Charities under the federal <em>Income Tax Act</em> (ITA) are required
     to file their <em>Corporations
     Information Act</em> Annual Return using either:


 <ul>
  <li>Charities RC232WS - Director/Officer
      Worksheet and Ontario <em>Corporations Information Act</em> Annual
      Return, or </li>
  <li>Charities RC232 &ndash; Ontario <em>Corporations Information
      Act </em>Annual Return Worksheet in combination with the
      T1235, Director/Trustees and Like Officials Worksheet.</li>
  <li>The appropriate worksheet(s) must be
      submitted along with the T3010 Registered Charity Information Return.</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>      Non-profit
corporations subject to the Ontario <em>Corporations Act </em>that are <em>NOT </em>Registered
Charities under the federal ITA are required to file a Schedule 546,<em> Corporations Information Act</em>
Annual Return for Ontario Corporations, together with their T2 return. </li>

</ul>



 

<p>Ontario
non-profit corporations will file their CIA AR to the Canada Revenue Agency
together with their tax or charity return within six months after the end of
their tax year. Previously, the CIA AR was filed within 60 days of the
anniversary of incorporation or amalgamation.</p>

 

<p>Non-profit corporations will continue
to have the option of filing a stand-alone CIA AR electronically with the
Service Providers under contract with the Ontario government. </p>

 

<p>Non-profit corporations that are
charities registered under the federal <em>Income Tax Act </em>will receive a
&lsquo;turnaround&rsquo; <em>Corporations Information Act</em> worksheet from the Canada
Revenue Agency that must be filed together with their T3010 Registered Charity
Information Return with the Canada Revenue Agency. Other non-profit
corporations will no longer receive a &lsquo;turnaround&rsquo; document.</p>

 

<p>The CIA AR must be filed with the
Canada Revenue Agency together with your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return or
your T3010 Registered Charity Information Return. <strong>The Canada Revenue Agency
will <em>not</em> accept a stand-alone <em>Corporations Information Act</em> Annual
Return</strong>. </p>


 
<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533077">5.5 </a>Penalties for Failure to Comply with Filing
Requirements</h3>

 

<p> The importance
of submitting these filings cannot be over-emphasized. Failure to comply may
lead to cancellation of the Letters Patent and dissolution of the corporation.
Penalties are provided in the<strong> <em>Corporations Information Act</em></strong> for
individuals (up to $2,000) and for corporations (up to $25,000) where reporting
requirements are not complied with. Also, a corporation that is in default of
the reporting requirements is not capable of maintaining an action in any court
in Ontario in respect of business carried on by the corporation except with
leave of the court.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533078">5.6 Additional Reporting Requirements</a></h3>

<p> Where a
corporation is regulated or funded by a Ministry or Agency of the Government,
it may be required to comply with other reporting requirements in addition to
those contained in the handbook.</p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533079">5.7 Audit Provisions</a></h3>

<p>For not-for-profit corporations whose annual  revenue is greater than $100,000, members of the corporation must appoint an auditor to hold office until the first annual meeting and at each annual meeting, must appoint one or more auditors to hold office until the next annual meeting. There is no waiving of this statutory requirement () section 130.1 of the Act.</p>

<p>In respect of a financial year of a corporation where the corporation’s annual income is less than $100,000 and where a resolution is passed by at least 80% of the votes cast by members at a general meeting (extraordinary resolution) to not appoint an auditor and to not have an audit, the corporation is exempt from a financial audit.</p>

<p>An amount other than $100,000 may be prescribed by regulation for the annual revenue of not-for-profit corporations for the purposes of an audit exemption.</p>
 

<h3 id="_Toc435533080">5.8 Record Keeping Requirements</a></h3>

 

<p> A
not-for-profit corporation is required, among other things, to meet certain
record keeping obligations such as:</p>

<ul>

	<li>proper	books of account and accounting records (section 302)</li>

	<li>minutes
	of meetings of members and directors (section 299)</li>

	<li>maintain copies of Letters
	Patent, Supplementary Letters Patent, By-Laws and Special Resolutions (section
	300)</li>

	<li>a register of its members and directors (section 300)</li>
	<li>a registry of a corporation&rsquo;s ownership interest in land that complies with section 300.1.**</li>

</ul>

<p>**The requirement for a corporation to keep a registry of a corporation&rsquo;s ownership interest took effect on December 10, 2016.  For a corporation that was incorporated or continued under the Act before December 10, 2016, this requirement applies to the corporation on or after December 10, 2018.  For a corporation incorporated or continued under the Act on or after December 10, 2016, this requirement applies on and after the day the corporation is incorporated or continued.  The registry requirement is in respect of the corporation&rsquo;s ownership interest on and after the day the requirement starts to apply to the corporation.</p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533081">5.9 Use of Corporate Name</a></h3>

<p> The name of a
corporation is set out in the instrument of incorporation (Letters Patent) or
if subsequently changed, in the instrument of amendment (Supplementary Letters
Patent) and that is the name that the corporation must use (for exception see
paragraph 5.11) in all transactions.</p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533082">5.10 Changing Corporate Name</a></h3>

 

<p> A corporation
may apply for Supplementary Letters Patent to change its corporate name. (see
section 131 of the Act and section 19 of Regulation 181)</p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533083">5.11 Use of a Name Other than Corporate Name</a></h3>

 

<p> A corporation
may use a name other than its corporate name. For example, a corporation
called Federation of Ontario Moose Callers may carry on its undertaking under
the assumed name &ldquo;Ontario Moose Callers&rdquo;.</p>

 

<p>However,
<strong>NO</strong> corporation shall carry on business in Ontario <strong>or</strong> identify
itself to the Ontario public by a name other than its corporate name unless the
assumed name is first registered with ServiceOntario (section 2(1) of the<strong><em>
Business Names Act</em></strong>). The appropriate registration form, (Form 2, under
the<strong> <em>Business Names Act</em>)</strong> is available on the ServiceOntario
website or in person from ServiceOntario. Business names can be searched and
registered online through ServiceOntario&rsquo;s website at <a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">www.ServiceOntario.ca</a>, through
self-help workstations and electronically through Service Providers under
contract with the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (see Contacts
Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

 

<p>A
corporation, which has registered and uses a name other than its corporate name
is required to set out both its registered name and its corporate name on all
contracts, invoices, negotiable instruments and orders for goods and services
issued or made by the corporation (Section 2 (6) of the<strong> <em>Business Names
Act</em></strong>).</p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533084">5.12 Changing the Authorized Number of Directors</a></h3>

 

<p> The number of
directors of a corporation is established at the time of incorporation, being
the number of first directors named in the Letters Patent.</p>

 

<p>The
board of directors of a corporation shall consist of a <strong>fixed</strong> number of
directors not fewer than three (subsection 283(2)).</p>

 

<p>A
corporation may by special resolution increase or decrease the number of its
directors (section 285). </p>

 

<p>&ldquo;Special
Resolution&rdquo; (section 1) means a resolution passed by the directors and confirmed
with or without variation by at least two-thirds of the votes cast at a general
meeting of the members of the corporation duly called for that purpose, or in
lieu of such confirmation, by the consent in writing of all the members
entitled to vote at such a meeting.</p>

 

<p>A
Notice of Change under the <strong><em>Corporations Information Act</em></strong> must
be filed with ServiceOntario within 15 days of any change to the directors of
the corporation (see part 5.4).</p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533085">5.13 Changing the Location of the Head Office</a></h3>

 

<p> The location
of the head office is established in the Letters Patent. However, a
corporation may by special resolution (see Part 5.12) change the location of
its head office to another place in Ontario (section 277).</p>

 

<p>A
Notice of Change under the <strong><em>Corporations Information Act</em></strong> must
be filed with ServiceOntario within 15 days of a change to the head office of
the corporation (see part 5.4).</p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533086">5.14 Changing the Objects and Special Provisions</a></h3>

 

<p> A corporation
may apply for Supplementary Letters Patent to change all or any of its objects
and/or special provisions set out in the Letters Patent (see section131 of the
Act and section 19 of the Regulations).</p>

 

<p>If
the corporation is, or after issuance of Supplementary Letters Patent, would be
funded, supervised, etc. by a Government Agency or Ministry, it is wise to
consult with the funding or supervising Agency or Ministry prior to completing
the application for Supplementary Letters Patent.</p>

 

<p>Applications
to change the objects or special provisions of Non-Profit Charitable
Corporations must be accompanied by evidence that the proposed change meets the
criteria for charitable corporations as set out by the Charitable Property
Program of the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (Ontario). (see part
6.6.1)</p>

 

<p>The
Application for Supplementary Letters Patent (Form 3 approved by the Minister
as provided for in the Regulations to the <strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong><em>)</em>,
is available on the ServiceOntario website or in person from the Ministry of
Government and Consumer Services (see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;). </p>

 

<p>Detailed
instructions for completion accompany each set of application forms and those instructions are not repeated in the
handbook. The information in this handbook is more general and is intended to
clarify and supplement the instructions that are supplied with the application
forms. </p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533087">5.15<em> Income Tax Act</em> Considerations</a></h3>

 

<p> A charity or
not-for-profit corporation may be exempt from federal income tax either as a
&ldquo;non-profit organization&rdquo; as described in paragraph 149(1)(l) of the federal <strong><em>Income
Tax Act</em></strong>, or if registered as a charity within the meaning of
section 149.1.</p>

 

<p>Although
an organization may not qualify for charitable status, the
non-profit-non-charitable designation may still be advantageous from a federal
income tax point of view. For more information visit the Canada Revenue Agency
website at: <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/">www.cra-arc.gc.ca</a>. </p>

 

<h3 id="_Toc435533088">5.16 Ontario Corporations Tax Requirements</a></h3>

 

<p> Corporations,
whether share or non-share, which are exempt from both income tax and capital
tax, are not required to file annual Ontario Corporations Tax Returns (CT-23)
with the Ontario Ministry of Finance.</p>

 

<p>Exempt
corporations are defined for income tax purposes under section 57 of the Ontario <strong><em>Corporations Tax Act</em></strong> (the Act) and for capital tax purposes
under section 71 of the Act. The <strong><em>Corporations Tax Act</em></strong> is
available on the ServiceOntario e-laws website at <a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/">www.e-laws.gov.on.ca</a> and should be

<h3 id="_Toc435533089">5.17 Dissolution - Surrender of the Charter</a></h3>

 

<p> Where a
corporation no longer serves the purpose for which it was incorporated or where
the members have lost interest in the corporation, it may be desirable for the
members to terminate the existence of the corporation. To voluntarily dissolve
a non-profit corporation pursuant to Section 319 of the Act an Application for
Surrender of Charter must be completed and submitted to ServiceOntario.
Charitable corporations must also obtain approval to the dissolution from the
Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (see part 6.6.2). </p>

 

<p>The
Application for Surrender of Charter/Termination of Corporate Existence, (Form
9 approved by the Minister as provided for in the Regulations to the <strong><em>Corporations
Act</em></strong><em>)</em>, is available by phone or in person from the Ministry of
Government and Consumer Services (see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;). </p>

<h2 id="_Toc435533090">PART 6 &ndash; CHARITIES</h2>

<p>These
guidelines are intended to provide some basic information on incorporating a
non-profit charitable corporation in Ontario. </p>

<h3 id="_Toc435533092">6.1 Incorporating a Charity</h3>

<p> <a
name="_Toc435533093">The
majority of Ontario charitable corporations are incorporated by Letters Patent
issued under the provincial </a><a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c38_e.htm"><strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong></a>. The procedure for incorporating a charity under the <a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c38_e.htm"><strong><em>Corporations Act</em></strong></a> is described in 6.2 and 6.3 below.</p>

<p>There
are two other ways to incorporate a charity.  They are not discussed in
detail in the Not-For-Profit Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook.  If you need further
information, you may contact the responsible organizations at the addresses set
out below.</p>

 

<h4><em>By private bill or special Act of the legislature</em></h4>

<p>The provincial legislature can pass a private bill or special Act establishing a
charity.  This procedure is generally more time-consuming than the two
other methods. Today very few charities are created by a private bill or special
Act of the legislature. </p>

<p>The rules of procedure and the fees and costs related to applications for private
bills are set out in the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly. Copies of
the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly and the guide &quot;<a
href="http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/go2.jsp?Page=/bills/private_bills_landing&amp;menuItem=bills_header&amp;locale=en">Procedures for Applying for Private Legislation</a>&quot; may be obtained from the
Legislative Assembly's Internet site or from the Clerk of the Standing
Committee on Regulations and Private Bills (see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

<h4><em>By federal Certificate of Incorporation issued through  Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada</em></h4>

<p>Certificates of incorporation can be issued under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/C-1.8">Canada</a> <cite>Not-for-profit Corporations Act</cite>. For particulars of application procedures, forms and fees applicants should contact Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Charities that operate or have property or offices in Ontario must also comply with Ontario law concerning charities even if they are incorporated under federal law.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533094">6.2 What is a
charitable corporation?</h3>

<p> Charities are a special kind of
not-for-profit corporation.  In order to be a charity, a corporation
must meet the general requirements for not-for-profit corporations and some
additional requirements.  A summary of these additional requirements is
set out below.</p>






<div class=WordSection6>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330941"><strong>6.2.1
The name of the corporation</strong></h4>

<p> The name of a charitable
corporation must comply with the <em><a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c38_e.htm"><strong><em>Corporations
Act</em></strong></a></em> (see
Part 2).  The name should also describe the purpose of the charity.  </p>

<p>With
the exception of applications to incorporate a foundation, the name of a person
or family should not be included in a charity&rsquo;s corporate name, as it is
perceived to promote a private interest. The name of a person or family may be
included in the name of a charitable corporation that is not a foundation if
the proposed corporate name has a connection with the objects of the
corporation and (a) has through use acquired a meaning that renders the name
distinctive; or (b) is of historic, patriotic or philanthropic significance.</p>

<p>An application to incorporate a foundation may include a person&rsquo;s name as part of
the corporate name for example, the &quot;Smith Foundation&quot;. If
&ldquo;Foundation&rdquo; is part of the corporate name, then the objects of the corporation
must include the foundation object clause: To receive and maintain a fund or
funds and to apply all or part of the principal and income therefrom, from time
to time, to charitable organizations that are also registered charities under
the <em><a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-3.3?noCookie">Income
Tax Act (Canada).</a></em> A foundation
may have other object clauses in addition to the foundation object clause but
at the very least should carry out the function of a foundation.</p>

<p>If the name of a person or family
is included in the corporate or foundation name, then the provisions relating
to an individual&rsquo;s given name and surname or family name in <a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_900181_e.htm">Regulation
181</a> of the <em><a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c38_e.htm">Corporations
Act</a></em> must be complied with.</p>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330942"><strong>6.2.2
The objects or purposes of the corporation</strong></h4>

<p>  The objects, or purposes, of a
corporation are set out in one or more paragraphs, in the Letters Patent,
called the object clauses.  The object clauses describe the nature of the
work the charitable corporation will undertake.</p>

<p>A corporation can carry out activities described in the object clauses. 
It can also carry out other activities provided they further the objects or are
minor in relation to the activities described in the object clauses.  It
is not permissible to use the property of the corporation for purposes,
charitable or not, which are outside the scope of the objects set out in the
Letters Patent. Examples of object clauses are found in Appendix &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For a corporation to be a charity, the objects must satisfy the following
requirements:</p>
<h5>The
objects of the corporation must be legally charitable:</h5>

<p>If a corporation is to be a charity its objects must be charitable in
law.  The legal meaning of charity is not the same as the popular meaning
of the word. A charity, in the legal sense, must be set up to carry out
activities that fall within one or all of the following headings: </p>

<ul>


<li>       
Relief of
poverty; </li>

<li>       
Advancement
of education; </li>

<li>       
Advancement
of religion; and </li>

<li>       
Other
purposes beneficial to the community, as determined by the courts, but not
falling under any of the above headings.</li>

</ul>



<p>It is
important that the object clauses clearly describe the activities the
corporation will carry out.  It is not acceptable simply to reproduce the
four principal headings of charity.</p>

<p>All of the objects of a charitable corporation must be charitable.  A
corporation which has some charitable objects and some non-charitable objects
is not a charity. </p>

<p>Objects must be stated precisely so that it is clear how the property of the
charity is supposed to be used.  If it is not clear whether an object is
charitable, the courts have decided that it will not be considered charitable. </p>

<h5>The
objects must promote a public benefit:</h5>

<p>A charity must benefit the community or a large part of the community -
not only a few people.  For example, raising funds for one person who
suffers from a disease is not considered charitable because it provides a
benefit only to that person.  Raising funds for disease research is considered
charitable because, while only the people who suffer from the disease benefit
directly from research, the community as a whole benefits from decreased health
care costs and decreased risk of contracting the disease.</p>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330953"><strong>6.2.3 Special Provisions</strong></h4>

<p>The
special provisions set out some of the duties and obligations of the charity
and its directors.  The Public Guardian and Trustee requires that the
special provisions found in Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo; be included in the application for
incorporation. </p>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330944"><strong>6.2.4 Natural Person Powers</strong></h4>

<p>Charitable corporations have the capacity, and subject to the Act, the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person (section 126.1 of the Act). This ensures that they have all the necessary powers to fulfill their objects without listing them individually. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to include the ancillary and incidental powers in the incorporating documents.</p>

<p>If a charitable corporation wishes to restrict its powers, such restrictions should be specified in clause 5 of the application under Special Provisions.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533095">6.3 How to Apply for Letters Patent</h3>

accordance with Parts 1 to 5 of this Handbook. In addition, you must follow the
guidelines set out in this Part.</p>

by telephone or in person from <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>
(see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Once
you have completed your <a

for Incorporation of a Corporation without Share Capital</a>, there are two
ways to apply for Letters Patent: </p>

<ol>

<li>       
<em>Directly through </em><em><a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a></em><em> using only pre-approved object and special provision
clauses</em>. 
The procedure for incorporation directly through <em><a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a></em> is set out in
6.3.1 below. </li>

<li>       
<em>Through the
Public Guardian and Trustee using object clauses drafted for your charity</em>. The procedure for
incorporations requiring the approval of the Public Guardian and Trustee is set
out in 6.3.2 below. <a name="applying_companies"></a></li>

</ol>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330951">6.3.1 Applying directly to ServiceOntario using only pre-approved object and special provision clauses</h4>

<p> The Public Guardian and Trustee has developed standard, pre-approved, object clauses for some of the most
common types of charitable corporations.  The pre-approved object clauses
are set out in <strong>Appendix &ldquo;C&rdquo;</strong><strong>.</strong> 
If you use only the pre-approved object clauses, you can apply directly to the <a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>.</p>

<h5>Deciding Whether to Use the Pre-approved Objects</h5>

<p>The pre-approved object clauses
cannot be used by all charities.  A charity should only use the
pre-approved object clauses if one or more of the clauses describe the intended
purposes of that organization.  It is important that the object clauses
accurately describe the charitable purposes the corporation will carry
out.  </p>

<p>Before
deciding to use the pre-approved object clauses you should think about the
activities your charity will carry out both on start-up and in the foreseeable
future. Engaging in activities beyond the scope of the objects set out in the
Letters Patent is not permissible.  Directors of a corporation which uses
property for purposes not in the object clauses may be required by a court to
repay the money used for other purposes.  </p>

<p>If
the pre-approved object clauses do not accurately describe the purposes you
intend the corporation to carry out, or if you wish to add additional object
clauses, the pre-approved object clauses should not be used.  Other object
clauses will have to be drafted and the application for incorporation must be
reviewed and approved by the Public Guardian and Trustee. (The procedure for
this is set out in 6.3.2 below)</p>

<h5>How to Use the Pre-approved Objects</h5>

<p>If
you use the pre-approved object clauses to apply directly to the <a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a> you must also include
the special provisions set out in <strong>Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo;</strong><strong>.</strong> These must be included
in Section 5 on page 3 of your application for incorporation.</p>

<p>To
use the pre-approved object clauses you must:</p>

<ol>

<li>       
Follow the
directions in Parts 1 to 5 of the Not-For-Profit Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook. </li>

<li>       
You may use
one or more of the pre-approved object clauses. </li>

<li>       
Fill in any
blank spaces with the relevant information (such as the particular faith or religion
in the religious category).</li>

<li>      Use the pre-approved object and
special provision clauses word-for-word. </li>

</ol>



<p>From
time to time, the Public Guardian and Trustee will approve additional
pre-approved object clauses. The list of pre-approved object clauses is
attached as <strong>Appendix &ldquo;C&rdquo;</strong><strong>.</strong></p>

<h5>Where to send it</h5>

<p>Send
your completed application to <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>,
Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (see Contacts &ndash; &ndash; Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;). </p>

<h5>Canada Revenue Agency</h5>

<p>If
you wish to issue tax receipts to donors, you must apply to Canada Revenue
Agency for a charitable registration number under the federal <em><a
href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-3.3"><strong><em>Income Tax Act</em></strong></a></em>.</p>

<p>Canada Revenue Agency has approved the Public Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s pre-approved object clauses to help simplify the application process for a charitable registration number. However, your organization&rsquo;s use of proper objects is only part of Canada Revenue Agency&rsquo;s requirements for charitable registration.  Canada Revenue Agency must take other factors into consideration, including the activities and programs your organization undertakes to achieve its objects.  For information on how to apply to <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/htply-eng.html">Canada Revenue Agency for charitable registration</a>, you may wish to contact Canada Revenue Agency, <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/charities/">Charities Directorate</a> in Ottawa (see Contacts &ndash; Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

<p>If
you intend to apply to Canada Revenue Agency for charitable registration and
wish to use any of the pre-approved object clauses, it is your responsibility
to make sure that you have used the pre-approved clauses word-for-word. 
Even if <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a> issues the
Letters Patent, Canada Revenue Agency may not approve the clauses if there is a
variation in wording.</p>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330952">6.3.2 Applications for incorporation through the
Public Guardian and Trustee</h4>

<p> All applicants who do not use the pre-approved
objects and special provision clauses must submit their applications for
incorporation to the Public Guardian and Trustee for approval.  Applicants
should submit their applications to the Public Guardian and Trustee as if they
were applying to the <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>

Not-For-Profit Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook).</p>

<h5>Objects </h5>

<p>If
you submit your application to the Public Guardian and Trustee for approval,
you may draft object clauses tailored to fit the unique nature of the work your
corporation will undertake.  The pre-approved object clauses in <strong>Appendix &ldquo;C&rdquo;</strong>
may help you in writing your own object clauses.  The Public Guardian and
Trustee will review your objects to determine whether they are charitable.</p>

<h5>Special Provisions </h5>

<p>The special provisions in Appendix &ldquo;D&rdquo;, must be included in section 5 on page 3 of the application. Any powers that are to be restricted should also be included under Special Provisions.</p>

<ul>
	

<li>     
Two duplicate
original signed copies of the application to the attention of the Charitable
Property Program. </li>

<li>     
A covering
letter setting out the name, address and telephone number of the person or firm
to whom the Letters Patent or any correspondence regarding the application
should be mailed. </li>

money order made payable to the Public Guardian and Trustee. This fee covers
the cost of the Public Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s review and the review and filing
fee of ServiceOntario. The fees as of the date of writing the Not-for-Profit
Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook are set out in <strong>Appendix &ldquo;F&rdquo;</strong><strong>.</strong> </li>

<li>     
An original
Ontario-biased <strong>Nuans</strong>
name search report (described in section 2.13 of the Not-For-Profit
Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook).  Remember that a <strong>Nuans</strong> search is only valid for 90
days.  You should make every effort to submit your application as soon as
possible after you obtain the Nuans report so that it does not expire before
the Public Guardian and Trustee and <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>
receive it. To obtain a Nuans Report, you may visit the Nuans Name Search
System at <a href="http://www.Nuans.com/nuansinfo_en/home-accueil_en.cgi">http://www.Nuans.com/nuansinfo_en/home-accueil_en.cgi</a>
, or check the yellow pages.</li>

<li>     
It is helpful
if the applicant provides any literature or documents showing the nature of the
organization&rsquo;s activities.  This is useful in deciding whether the objects
are within the legal definition of charity. </li>

<li>     
If the
organization is already in operation and wishes to become an incorporated
charity, copies of its previous financial statements, governing documents and
the names of the members of the board of trustees should be included. </li>

<h4>6.3.3 Grounds for refusing applications for charitable organizations</h4>

<p> The following are some of the reasons for which the
Public Guardian and Trustee may refuse to approve an application to incorporate
a charitable organization:</p>

<ul>

	

<li>   
Objects are
not wholly and exclusively charitable </li>

<li>   
Objects are
too broad or are vague </li>

<li>   
The power
clauses include a purpose which is not legally charitable </li>

<li>   
There are
concerns that the proposed charity will not be properly administered,
considering a previous failure of the incorporators to comply with the law
relating to charities </li>

<li>   
The
organization has been operating as an unincorporated association and its
financial documents show a disproportionate amount of charitable funds are
being used for non-charitable purposes or administrative expenses </li>

<li>   
The name of
the organization does not reflect the purposes set out in the application </li>

<li>   
The
organization is primarily promoting private members&rsquo; interests or benefits </li>

<li>   
The
organization is pursuing political purposes </li>

<li>   
The
organization&rsquo;s liabilities exceed its assets </li>

</ul>


<p>If
your application does not meet the Public Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s requirements
you will be notified of the deficiencies and, in most cases, given an opportunity
to amend your application.</p>

<br>
<h3 id="_Toc435533096">6.4 Benefits of being a charity</h3>

<p> Charities enjoy certain tax privileges.  Charities have exemption from, and reduced liability for,
some municipal, provincial and federal taxes.  Registered charities under
the federal <em><a
href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-3.3"><strong><em>Income Tax Act</em></strong></a></em> can issue income tax donation receipts
so that donors can obtain tax credits. </p>

<p>Charities enjoy legal protections intended to protect charitable property.  When a charitable purpose becomes impossible or impracticable to carry out, the courts apply charitable property to new purposes which are as similar as possible to the original purposes.  A charity reporting to the Public Guardian and Trustee derives the following benefits:</p>

<p>A
charity reporting to the Public Guardian and Trustee derives the following
benefits:</p>

<ul>

	

<li>   
Members of
the public, charitable foundations and government agencies that provide funding
and donations often seek confirmation from the Public Guardian and Trustee that
the charity is complying with the Public Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s reporting
requirements. </li>

<li>   
The Public
Guardian and Trustee maintains a database of Ontario charities that is
regularly used to find charities entitled to receive gifts under Ontario estates. </li>

<li>   
The Public
Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s database may also be used to identify charities which
may be suitable to receive the property of dissolved charities or gifts from
estates to non-existent, defunct or unidentifiable charities. </li>

<h4> <strong>Governing Law</strong> </h4>

<p>If
a religious organization becomes incorporated, its ecclesiastical, canon or
church laws, rules or regulations may be subject to the <em><a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c38_e.htm"><strong><em>Corporations

applications reviewed by the Public Guardian and Trustee</h3>

<h4 id="_Toc4355330981">6.6.1 Supplementary Letters Patent</h4>

<p> Supplementary Letters Patent are needed to change
the name, objects or powers of an incorporated charity.  Supplementary
Letters Patent to change only the name of the corporation do not require the
approval of the Public Guardian and Trustee. You can send the application for
Supplementary Letters Patent to change the name of the corporation directly to <a
href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>.  However, all
other applications by charities for Supplementary Letters Patent do require the
approval of the Public Guardian and Trustee. </p>

<p>The Form 3, &ldquo;Application for Supplementary Letters Patent&rdquo; is available by clicking
at <a href="http://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/GetAttachDocs/007-07108~1/$File/07108E.pdf">http://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/GetAttachDocs/007-07108~1/$File/07108E.pdf</a>,
or by visiting the <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>
website at <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">www.ServiceOntario.ca</a> or
by telephone or in person from <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>
(see Contacts - Appendix &ldquo;G&rdquo;).</p>

<h5>Supplementary Letters Patent to Change Objects </h5>

<p>As a general principle, once charitable objects are declared, they can only be changed in limited circumstances.  This is the case even if new objects would be more beneficial to society.</p>

<p>Circumstances in which charitable objects may be amended include changes that are not significant.  Examples of such changes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deleting objects the corporation no longer intends to carry out or narrowing the scope of the objects.</li> 
	<li>Rewriting the objects to reflect social changes in the use of certain terminology, for example replacing words such as “crippled” with “disabled”.</li> 
	<li>Expanding or otherwise changing the power clauses.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Changes may also be made if the objects have become obsolete, not useful, or impossible to fulfill.  In these cases, a detailed explanation is required to be provided to the Public Guardian and Trustee that shows how the objects fall within one or more of these categories.</p>

<h5><em>Significant Changes</em></h5>

<p>If the exceptions noted above do not apply, Tthe Public Guardian and Trustee will be concerned if  the proposed change to the objects is so significant that the revised objects depart from the spirit and intent of the original objects.  In that case, applicants may be required to include in the application for Supplementary Letters Patent a paragraph similar to the following:</p>

<p>“All funds and other property held by the corporation immediately before these Supplementary Letters Patent become effective or at any time thereafter received by the corporation pursuant to any Will, deed or other instrument made before these Supplementary Letters Patent become effective, together with all income thereon and accretions thereto, shall be applied only to the objects of the corporation as they were immediately before these Supplementary Letters Patent become effective.”</p>

<p>The effect of this paragraph is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Property acquired after the Supplementary Letters Patent become effective can only be used for the objects as changed by the Supplementary Letters Patent.</li>
	<li>Property acquired before the Supplementary Letters Patent become effective can only be used for the objects in place before they were changed by the Supplementary Letters Patent. This includes income received from a Will, deed or other document made before the Supplementary Letters Patent became effective.</li> 
</ul>

<h5>Special Provisions</h5>

<p>When a charity submits an application for Supplementary Letters Patent, it should also check to see if all of the special provisions mentioned in Appendix “D” have been included in its incorporating documents. If any of the special provisions are missing or need to be up-dated, the charity may be asked to amend its application for Supplementary Letters Patent.</p>

<h5><strong>What to Send</strong></h5>

<p>The following should be sent to
the Public Guardian and Trustee for review: </p>

<ul>

	

<li>     
Duplicate
original signed copies of an application for Supplementary Letters Patent. </li>

<li>     
A covering
letter setting out the name, address and telephone number of the person or firm
to whom the Supplementary Letters Patent, or any correspondence regarding the
application should be mailed and setting out all names, including acronyms used
by the charity. </li>

<li>     
A cheque or
money order payable to the Public Guardian and Trustee.  This fee covers
the cost of the Public Guardian and Trustee&rsquo;s review and the review and filing
fee of ServiceOntario. The fees as of the date of the Not-For-Profit
Incorporator&rsquo;s Handbook are set out in <strong>Appendix &ldquo;F&rdquo;</strong><strong>.</strong> </li>

<li>     
A copy of the
Letters Patent and any prior Supplementary Letters Patent, unless they have
already been filed with our Office. </li>

<li>     
The current
names and addresses of the directors and officers. </li>

<li>The annual audited financial statements for the last three financial years. For the period after August 1, 2007, unaudited financial statements may be accepted from charities with gross annual  revenue of less than $100,000.</li>

<li>If the Supplementary Letters Patent contains a change to the name of the corporation, you must send an original Ontario-biased Nuans name search report (described in section 2.13 of the Not-For-Profit Incorporator’s Handbook) with your application but remember that a Nuans search is only valid for 90 days. You should make every effort to submit your application as soon as possible after you obtain the Nuans report so that it does not expire before the Public Guardian and Trustee and the ServiceOntario receive it. To obtain a Nuans Report, you may visit the <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/075.nsf/eng/home">Nuans Name Search website</a>, or check the yellow pages.</li>

<li>Any other documentation in support of the proposed changes.</li>

</ul>

<p> Once an application for
Supplementary Letters Patent is approved, the Public Guardian and Trustee will
forward it to <a href="http://www.serviceontario.ca/">ServiceOntario</a>. 
If the application for Supplementary Letters Patent meets the separate

will issue the Supplementary Letters Patent. </p>


<h4 id="_Toc4355330982">6.6.2 Dissolution and surrender of charter</h4>

<p> Letters Patent generally set out
what will happen to the property of the corporation if the corporation ceases
to exist.  Usually, the Letters Patent state that upon dissolution, and
after payment of all debts and liabilities, the charity&rsquo;s remaining property
will be distributed or disposed of to charities registered under the <em><a
href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-3.3"><strong><em>Income Tax Act
(Canada)</em></strong></a></em>, in Canada. This is referred to
as a &ldquo;dissolution clause&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If
the Letters Patent have a dissolution clause, the directors should pass a
resolution to name the charity they want to receive the charity&rsquo;s remaining
assets upon dissolution.  This resolution should be passed before the
charity is dissolved.</p>

<p>If
the Letters Patent do not have a dissolution clause, the directors will have to
pass a by-law to distribute the charity&rsquo;s remaining assets to other charitable
organizations upon dissolution.  This by-law should be passed before the
charity is dissolved.  After the directors have passed the by-law they
should call a general meeting to confirm the by-law.  The by-law must be
confirmed by two thirds of the votes cast at the meeting. </p>

<p>If the directors do not distribute the charity’s property, it will be forfeited to the Crown under section 322 of the <cite>Corporations Act</cite>. Depending on the kind of forfeited property, the Public Guardian and Trustee may be responsible for its disposition under the <cite>Escheats Act, 2015</cite> or the Ministry of Infrastructure under the <cite>Forfeited Corporate Property Act, 2015</cite>.</p>

<p>In the course of dissolution, the charity should not pay any salary, remuneration, or honorarium to its directors. Neither should a director purchase any property of the charity, without  approval of the court or an order under section 13 of the <cite>Charities Accounting Act</cite> (see next section).</p>

<h5>Special Purpose Funds </h5>

<p>If money or other property is
given to a charity for a special purpose, the charity must use the money for
the special purpose - it holds the money in trust for that purpose. 
Directors of a dissolving charity must be careful to point out to the charity
receiving the trust money that it is to be used only for the special purpose.</p>

<p>The
last directors of a charity have an obligation to ensure that any special trust
property is distributed when the corporation is dissolved.  If money is
held by a charity for a special purpose and it is not possible to carry out
that special purpose, the charity will need a Court Order to dispose of the
property.  An order can be obtained quickly and relatively inexpensively
using Section 13 of the <em><a
href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c10_e.htm"><strong><em>Charities Accounting Act</em></strong></a></em>,
on the consent of the Public Guardian and Trustee.  The Public Guardian
and Trustee will work with the last directors of the charity to obtain such an
order.  You should contact the Charitable Property Program to see if this
is feasible in your particular circumstances. </p>
